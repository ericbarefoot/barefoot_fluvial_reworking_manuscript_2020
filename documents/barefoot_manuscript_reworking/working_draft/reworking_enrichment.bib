	abstract = {Landscapes respond to climate, tectonic motions and sea level, but this response is mediated by sediment transport. Understanding transmission of environmental signals is crucial for predicting landscape response to climate change, and interpreting paleo-climate and tectonics from stratigraphy. Here we propose that sediment transport can act as a nonlinear filter that completely destroys (“shreds”) environmental signals. This results from ubiquitous thresholds in sediment transport systems; e.g., landsliding, bed load transport, and river avulsion. This “morphodynamic turbulence” is analogous to turbulence in fluid flows, where energy injected at one frequency is smeared across a range of scales. We show with a numerical model that external signals are shredded when their time and amplitude scales fall within the ranges of morphodynamic turbulence. As signal frequency increases, signal preservation becomes the exception rather than the rule, suggesting a critical re-examination of purported sedimentary signals of external forcing.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial paleoclimate records rely on proxies hosted in alluvial strata whose beds are deposited by unsteady and nonlinear geomorphic processes. It is broadly assumed that this renders the resultant time series of terrestrial paleoclimatic variability noisy and incomplete. We evaluate this assumption using a model of oscillating climate and the precise topographic evolution of an experimental alluvial system. We find that geomorphic stochasticity can create aliasing in the time series and spurious climate signals, but these issues are eliminated when the period of climate oscillation is longer than a key time scale of internal dynamics in the geomorphic system. This emergent autogenic geomorphic behavior imparts regularity to deposition and represents a natural discretization interval of the continuous climate signal. We propose that this time scale in nature could be in excess of 104 years but would still allow assessments of the rates of climate change at resolutions finer than the existing age model techniques in isolation.
Mesoscale geomorphic processes impose regularity in deposition, allowing quantitative resolution of proxy-based climate reconstructions.

Several inter-related effects which influence the distribution of channel-belt sand and gravel bodies within overbank fines are accounted for. These are (a) laterally variable aggradation, (b) compaction of fine sediment, (c) tectonic movement at floodplain margins, and (d) channel avulsion. Selected experiments with the model show how the interconnectedness and areal density of channel-belt deposits decrease with increasing floodplain width/channel-belt size, mean avulsion period, and channel-belt aggradation rate. Separation of stream patterns based on interconnectedness and channel deposit density is difficult. Tectonic movements do not have a significant influence upon the successions unless a preferred direction of tilting is maintained (half-graben). Then channel-belt deposits showing offlap tendencies tend to cluster adjacent to the active floodplain margin, leaving dominantly fine-grained alluvium to accumulate on the inactive side. Individual channel-belt deposits thicken during aggradation, although a self-regulating limit to such thickening is likely to operate. ‘Multistorey’features resulting from aggradation may be difficult to tell apart from those arising through superposition of distinct channel-belt deposits of avulsive origin.},

	abstract = {Various, but related, models have been proposed to explain the architectural arrangement of channel stacking patterns in avulsion-dominated alluvial sequences. The early models published by Leeder, Allen, and Bridge ({LAB}) addressed the role of changes in sedimentation rate (a proxy for subsidence rate) as a control on stacking patterns. The models decouple avulsion frequency from sedimentation rates, resulting in an inverse relationship between stacking density (or interconnectedness) and sedimentation rates. A key element missing from these models is the likely dependence of avulsion frequency on local sedimentation rate within the active channel belt. We consider a simple model whereby avulsion takes place only when a minimum, critical, relief is developed between a channel bank and the adjacent flood plain. If avulsion frequency increases at rates slower than the increase in sedimentation rate, then stacking density increases with decreasing sedimentation rate, similar to that predicted by the {LAB} models. However, if avulsion frequency increases linearly with sedimentation rate, then there is no change in stacking pattern with changes in sedimentation rate. If avulsion frequency increases faster than sedimentation rates, as seen in some data sets, then stacking patterns become more dense with increasing sedimentation rates, a result that is the exact opposite of that predicted by the {LAB} models. Therefore sensitive dependence on the relationship between avulsion frequency and sedimentation rate calls into question the veracity of some previous interpretations of relative subsidence made in alluvial architecture studies. We provide an alternative, simple geometric model that links changes in subsidence rate to downstream rate of change in stacking pattern as seen in three dimensions within sedimentary basins. Other controls that are considered include: the geometry of subsidence; whether avulsions take place locally along a river or regionally affect the basin; whether local sedimentation rate or flow depth controls the thickness of sand bodies; and the exact relationship between avulsion frequency and sedimentation rate. The primary result of the model is that subsidence strongly influences the rate at which alluvial architecture changes in the downstream direction, but other controls dictate whether the stacking pattern becomes more dense or less dense downstream. Hence, we suggest that subsidence exerts an influence on stacking patterns not necessarily evident in individual vertical sections, but may be recorded in three dimensions as downstream changes in alluvial architecture. Unfortunately any model of alluvial architecture in avulsion-dominated sequences is limited by our lack of understanding of the processes controlling avulsion. As a result any model of alluvial stacking patterns is at best a working hypothesis that should not be taken as proof of changes in tectonic subsidence rates or sea-level changes.},

	shorttitle = {Paleosols in clastic sedimentary rocks},
	abstract = {Interest in pre-Quaternary paleosols has increased over the past decade, in large part, because they have proved to be beneficial in solving diverse geological problems. The majority of paleosols are described from continental deposits, most commonly from alluvial strata. Criteria for recognizing these paleosols have been extensively described; however, classifying them has proved more complicated. Pre-Quaternary paleosols are generally classified according to one or more modern soil classification systems, although one new classification has been proposed exclusively for paleosols to avoid problems using the modern soil classifications. In addition to taxonomic classification, paleosols can be categorized according to the interplay among deposition, erosion, and the rate of pedogenesis when they formed. Paleosols can be solitary if they formed during a period of landscape stability following the development of an unconformity. Such paleosols are commonly thick and extremely well developed. More commonly, paleosols are vertically stacked or multistory because they formed in sedimentary systems undergoing net aggradation. If erosion was insignificant and sedimentation was rapid and unsteady, compound paleosols generally formed. If the rate of pedogenesis exceeded the rate of deposition, composite paleosols developed. Thick, cumulative paleosols indicate that erosion was insignificant and that sedimentation was relatively steady. Both autogenic and allogenic processes can influence depositional and erosion patterns and, thus, affect the kinds of soils that form. Consequently, paleosols can help to interpret the history of sediment deposition and the autogenic and allogenic processes that influenced a sedimentary basin. Paleosols are also helpful in stratigraphic studies, including sequence stratigraphic analyses. They are used for stratigraphic correlations at the local and basinal scale, and some workers have calculated sediment accumulation rates based on the degree of paleosol development. In addition to their stratigraphic applications, paleosols can be used to interpret landscapes of the past by analyzing paleosol–landscape associations at different spatial scales, ranging from local to basin-wide in scope. At the local scale, lateral changes in paleosol properties are largely the result of variations in grain size and topography. At the scale of the sedimentary basin, paleosols in different locations differ because of basinal variations in topography, grain size, climate, and subsidence rate. Paleosols are used to reconstruct ancient climates, even to estimate ancient mean annual precipitation ({MAP}) and mean annual temperature ({MAT}). Ancient climatic conditions can be interpreted from modern soil analogs or by identifying particular pedogenic properties that modern studies show to have climatic significance. Stable carbon and oxygen isotopes are also used to interpret ancient climate, and some effort has been made to estimate {MAT} from isotopic composition. On the basis of modern soil analogs, paleo-precipitation has been estimated from the depth at which calcic horizons originally formed. Finally, paleosol carbonates have been used to estimate ancient atmospheric {CO}2 values.},

	abstract = {The stratigraphic interval spanning the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum in the northern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming shows changes in the alluvial record that can be tied to a high resolution climate record. The complexity and stratigraphic spacing of paleosols change through the study section. Comparison to the climate record, reconstructed from paleosols, indicates the changes correspond to Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum climatic fluctuations. In particular, the middle of the section contains thick, welded paleosols and thin avulsion deposits that link to times of well-drained floodplains and lower mean annual precipitation. Stratigraphic intervals below and above the main part of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum interval correspond to times of less well drained floodplains and higher mean annual precipitation. These strata contain thinner paleosols and thick avulsion deposits. Differences in paleosol complexity and spacing suggest that sediment flux to the depositional site varied in response to precipitation fluctuations associated with the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Welded paleosols and thin avulsion deposits indicate reduced floodplain accretion during deposition of the middle of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. Intervals with widely spaced paleosols indicate more rapid accretion. We hypothesize that drier episodes associated with warming caused reduced vegetation in source areas and promoted erosion and increased sediment yield. Because precipitation was reduced, much of that sediment was stored in upstream reaches of the fluvial system rather than moving to the depositional basin. Welded paleosols formed because of diminished sediment supply to the basin. With a return to wetter conditions during the recovery phase of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, upstream water flux increased, stored sediment moved to the basin, and vertically spaced, thinner paleosols developed. The results demonstrate how vertical sections of alluvial paleosols can provide information on how climate fluctuated through time and how the fluvial system responded to climate change.},

	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ({PETM}) hyperthermal, {\textasciitilde}56millionyears ago (Ma), is the most dramatic example of abrupt Cenozoic global warming. During the {PETM} surface temperatures increased between 5 and 9°C and the onset likely took {\textless}20kyr. The {PETM} provides a case study of the impacts of rapid global warming on the Earth system, including both hydrological and associated biogeochemical feedbacks, and proxy data from the {PETM} can provide constraints on changes in warm climate hydrology simulated by general circulation models ({GCMs}). In this paper, we provide a critical review of biological and geochemical signatures interpreted as direct or indirect indicators of hydrological change at the {PETM}, explore the importance of adopting multi-proxy approaches, and present a preliminary model-data comparison. Hydrological records complement those of temperature and indicate that the climatic response at the {PETM} was complex, with significant regional and temporal variability. This is further illustrated by the biogeochemical consequences of inferred changes in hydrology and, in fact, changes in precipitation and the biogeochemical consequences are often conflated in geochemical signatures. There is also strong evidence in many regions for changes in the episodic and/or intra-annual distribution of precipitation that has not widely been considered when comparing proxy data to {GCM} output. Crucially, {GCM} simulations indicate that the response of the hydrological cycle to the {PETM} was heterogeneous – some regions are associated with increased precipitation – evaporation (P – E), whilst others are characterised by a decrease. Interestingly, the majority of proxy data come from the regions where {GCMs} predict an increase in {PETM} precipitation. We propose that comparison of hydrological proxies to {GCM} output can be an important test of model skill, but this will be enhanced by further data from regions of model-simulated aridity and simulation of extreme precipitation events.},

	abstract = {The Earth’s sedimentary successions are an archive of past tectonic and climate events1,2. The physical characteristics of the sediment record are controlled by three main factors: the sediment supply from the eroding source region, the grain size distribution of that sediment supply, and the area available for sediment accumulation in the downstream regions3,4. The interplay of these factors can make the interpretation of a climatic or tectonic signal complex, particularly as these processes are nonlinear. Here we assess the evolution of a tectonically active landscape undergoing erosional and depositional processes, using a numerical model that incorporates variations in grain size and the volumetric sediment budget. Our simulations indicate that changes in precipitation and tectonic uplift both generate characteristic patterns of grain size and stratigraphic geometry. An increase in catchment precipitation results in the deposition of a laterally extensive sheet of coarse gravel. The responses to a changing tectonic regime are more diverse: a large increase in uplift rate results first in the deposition of sediments of larger grain size at proximal sites, followed by a reduction in grain size at distal locations. We conclude that the stratigraphic record is strongly controlled by the grain size of sediments released from catchments undergoing tectonic or climatic change.},

Here, we present stable isotope, carbonate content, organic matter content, and C:N ratio records through the {PETM} from new outcrop sections in California and from cores previously drilled on the New Jersey margin. Foraminifer δ18O data suggest that midlatitude shelves warmed by a similar magnitude as the open ocean (5°C–8°C), while the carbon isotope excursion ({CIE}), recorded both in carbonate and organic matter δ13C records, is slightly larger (3.3–4.5‰) than documented in open ocean records. Sediment accumulation rates increase dramatically during the {CIE} in marked contrast to the open ocean sites. In parallel, mass accumulation rates of both organic and inorganic carbon also increased by an order of magnitude. The estimated total mass of accumulated carbon in excess of pre-{CIE} rates suggests that continental margins, at least along North America, became carbon sinks during the {CIE}, mainly because of weathering feedbacks and rising sea level. This result is significant because it implies that the negative feedback role of carbon burial on continental margins was greater than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {Despite the large number of studies on the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum ({PETM}), the knowledge of environmental and biotic responses in shallow marine environments remains quite poor. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages of the Sidi Nasseur and Wadi Mezaz sections in Tunisia were studied quantitatively and the paleoecologic interpretations provide new insights into the complex relationship between {PETM} global warming and perturbations of shallow marine settings. These sections expose upper Paleocene to lower Eocene shales and marls of the El Haria Formation up to the phosphate layers of the Chouabine Formation underlying the El Garia limestones. The Sidi Nasseur section contains a more complete and expanded Paleocene–Eocene boundary interval compared to Wadi Mezaz, although being truncated at the top. The Wadi Mezaz section contains a more complete post-{PETM} interval. The studied interval can be subdivided into a sequence of 4 biofacies, representing respectively a latest Paleocene biofacies, two {PETM} biofacies and one post-{PETM} Eocene biofacies. The latest Paleocene biofacies 1 consists of numerous calcareous benthic foraminifera (e.g. Anomalinoides midwayensis, Frondicularia aff. phosphatica and various Bulimina and Lenticulina species), abundant non-calcareous taxa (Haplophragmoides) and rare planktic foraminifera, indicating a slightly hypersaline eutrophic inner neritic to coastal environment, regularly interrupted by oxygen deficiency (moderate dysoxia). During the latest Paleocene, this highly productive environment shallowed as indicated by the increasing abundances of A. midwayensis. The variable dominance of non-calcareous agglutinated taxa in biofacies 1 indicates post-mortem dissolution effects. The {TOC} δ13Corg record reveals a sharp negative excursion, marking the base of the Eocene. In general, the absence of lithologic changes, an increasing sedimentation rate and absence of reworking indicate that the initial part of the {PETM} is complete and expanded in the Sidi Nasseur section. A sharp faunal turnover coincides with this negative δ13Corg excursion and is characterized by the disappearance or diminution of common Paleocene taxa in this area. During the {PETM}, benthic foraminifera are less abundant and consist of opportunistic non-calcareous taxa together with deeper dwelling (middle neritic) lagenids and buliminids (biofacies 2 and 3). Planktic foraminifera, dominated by flat-spired Acarinina (mainly A. multicamerata), become more abundant, as observed in many open marine sequences worldwide. All these faunal parameters suggest more stressed probably severe dysoxic sea floor conditions within a transgressive phase during the onset of the {PETM}. An estimation of the total duration of the Sidi Nasseur {PETM} interval is difficult to establish, yet the lack of recovery carbon isotope values suggests that the preserved {PETM} interval reflects only a part of the {CIE} “core”. The top of the {PETM} interval is truncated due to local (?) erosion during the early Eocene. The Eocene recovery fauna is mainly composed of Lenticulina and Stainforthia species (biofacies 4), indicating restricted coastal to hyposaline lagoonal eutrophic conditions, distinctly different from earlier environmental conditions.},

Analogous changes have been reported for an episode of millennial-scale 5 °C warming, termed the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ({PETM}; 56 Ma), providing independent constraints on hydrological response to global warming. However, quantifying hydrologic extremes during geologic global warming analogs has proven difficult. Here we show that water discharge increased by at least 1.35 and potentially up to 14 times during the early phase of the {PETM} in northern Spain. We base these estimates on analyses of channel dimensions, sediment grain size, and palaeochannel gradients across the early {PETM}, which is regionally marked by an abrupt transition from overbank palaeosol deposits to conglomeratic fluvial sequences. We infer that extreme floods and channel mobility quickly denuded surrounding soil-mantled landscapes, plausibly enhanced by regional vegetation decline, and exported enormous quantities of terrigenous material towards the ocean. These results support hypotheses that extreme rainfall events and associated risks of flooding increase with global warming at similar, but potentially at much higher, magnitudes than currently predicted.},

	abstract = {The effects of climate change on eroding landscapes and the terrestrial sedimentary record are poorly understood. Using mountain catchment–alluvial fan systems as simple analogues for larger landscapes, a wide range of theoretical studies, numerical models and physical experiments have hypothesized that a change in precipitation rate could leave a characteristic signal in alluvial fan sediment flux, grain size and down-system fining rate. However, this hypothesis remains largely untested in real landscapes. This study measures grain-size fining rates from apex to toe on two alluvial fan systems in northern Death Valley, California, {USA}, which each have well-exposed modern and ca 70 ka surfaces, and where the long-term tectonic boundary conditions can be constrained. Between them, these surfaces capture a well-constrained temporal gradient in climate. A grain-size fining model is adapted, based on self-similarity and selective deposition, for application to these alluvial fans. This model is then integrated with cosmogenic nuclide constraints on catchment erosion rates, and observed grain-size fining data from two catchment-fan systems, to estimate the change in sediment flux from canyon to alluvial fan that occurred between mid-glacial and modern interglacial conditions. In a fan system with negligible sediment recycling, a ca 30\% decrease in precipitation rate led to a 20\% decrease in sediment flux and a clear increase in the down-fan rate of fining, supporting existing landscape evolution models. Consequently, this study shows that small mountain catchments and their alluvial fan stratigraphy can be highly sensitive to orbital climate changes over {\textless}105 year timescales. However, in the second fan system it is observed that this sensitivity is completely lost when sediment is remobilized and recycled over a time period longer than the duration of the climatic perturbation. These analyses offer a new approach to quantitatively reconstructing the effects of past climate changes on sedimentation, using simple grain-size data measured in the field.},

The geomorphic and stratigraphic products of this source-to-sink sediment transfer record signals of external environmental forcings, as well as internal, or autogenic, dynamics of the sedimentary system. Here, we evaluate environmental signal propagation across sediment-routing systems with emphasis on sediment supply, Qs, as the carrier of up-system forcings. We review experimental, numerical, and natural examples of source-to-sink sediment routing and signal propagation during three timescales: (1) historic, which includes measurement and monitoring of events and processes of landscape change and deposition during decades to centuries; (2) centuries to several millions of years, referred to as intermediate timescale; and (3) deep time. We discuss issues related to autogenic dynamics of sediment transport, transient storage, and release that can introduce noise, lags, and/or completely mask signals of external environmental forcings. We provide a set of conceptual and practical tools for evaluating sediment supply within a source-to-sink context, which can inform interpretations of signals from the sedimentary record. These tools include stratigraphic and sediment-routing system characterization, sediment budgets, geochronology, detrital mineral analysis (e.g., thermochronology), comparative analog approaches, and modeling techniques to measure, calculate, or estimate the magnitude and frequency of external forcings compared to the characteristic response time of the sediment-routing systems.},

	abstract = {The growth of quantitative analysis and prediction in Earth-surface science has been accompanied by growth in experimental stratigraphy and geomorphology. Experimenters have grown increasingly bold in targeting landscape elements from channel reaches up to the entire erosional networks and depositional basins, often using very small facilities. The experiments produce spatial structure and kinematics that, although imperfect, compare well with natural systems despite differences of spatial scale, time scale, material properties, and number of active processes. Experiments have been particularly useful in studying a wide range of forms of self-organized (autogenic) complexity that occur in morphodynamic systems. Autogenic dynamics creates much of the spatial structure we see in the landscape and in preserved strata, and is strongly associated with sediment storage and release. The observed consistency between experimental and field systems despite large differences in governing dimensionless numbers is what we mean by “unreasonable effectiveness”. We suggest that unreasonable experimental effectiveness arises from natural scale independence. We generalize existing ideas to relate internal similarity, in which a small part of a system is similar to the larger system, to external similarity, in which a small copy of a system is similar to the larger system. We propose that internal similarity implies external similarity, though not the converse. The external similarity of landscape experiments to natural landscapes suggests that natural scale independence may be even more characteristic of morphodynamics than it is of better studied cases such as turbulence. We urge a shift in emphasis in experimental stratigraphy and geomorphology away from classical dynamical scaling and towards a quantitative understanding of the origins and limits of scale independence. Other research areas with strong growth potential in experimental surface dynamics include physical–biotic interactions, cohesive effects, stochastic processes, the interplay of structural and geomorphic self-organization, extraction of quantitative process information from landscape and stratigraphic records, and closer interaction between experimentation and theory.},

	abstract = {Stratigraphy preserves an extensive record of Earth-surface dynamics acting over a range of scales in a variety of environments. To take advantage of this record, we first must distinguish depositional patterns that arise due to intrinsic (i.e., autogenic) landscape dynamics from sedimentation that results from changes in climate, tectonic, or eustatic boundary conditions. The compensation statistic is a quantitative tool that has been used to estimate scales and patterns of autogenic sedimentation in experimental deposits; it has been applied to a few outcrop studies, but its sensitivity to data limitations common in natural deposits remains unconstrained. To explore how the compensation statistic may be applied to outcrop data, we evaluate the sensitivity of the tool to stratigraphic data sets limited in extent and resolution by subsampling an autogenic experimental deposit to create pseudo-outcrop-scale data sets. Results show that for data sets more than 3 times thicker than a characteristic depositional element (e.g., channel or lobe), the compensation statistics that can be used reliably constrain the maximum scale of autogenic sedimentation even for low-resolution data sets. Additionally, we show that autogenic sedimentation patterns may be characterized as persistent, random, or compensational using the compensation statistic when data sets are high resolution. We demonstrate how these measurements can be applied to natural data sets with comparative case studies of two fluvial and two deltaic outcrops. These case studies show how the compensation statistic can provide insight into what controls the maximum scale of autogenic sedimentation in different systems and how landscape dynamics can produce organized sedimentation patterns over long time scales.},

	abstract = {{AbstractStratigraphy} contains the most complete record of information necessary to quantitatively reconstruct paleolandscape dynamics, but this record contains significant gaps over a range of time and space scales. These gaps result from stasis on geomorphic surfaces and erosional events that remove previously deposited sediment. Building on earlier statistical studies, we examine stratigraphic completeness in three laboratory experiments where the topography of aggrading deltas was monitored at high temporal and spatial scales. The three experiments cover unique combinations in the absolute magnitudes of sediment and water discharge in addition to generation of accommodation space through base-level rise. This analysis centers on three time scales: (1) the time at which a record is discretized (t), (2) the time necessary to build a deposit with mean thickness equivalent to the maximum roughness on a surface (Tc), and (3) the time necessary for channelized flow to migrate over all locations in a basin (Tch). These time scales incorporate information pertaining to the time-variant topography of actively changing surfaces, kinematics by which the surfaces are changing, and net deposition rate. We find that stratigraphic completeness increases as a function of t/Tc but decreases as a function of Tc/Tch over the parameter space covered in the experiments. Our results suggest that environmental signals disconnected from a sediment routing system are best preserved in systems with low Tc values. Nondimensionalizing t by Tc, however, shows that preservation of information characterizing system morphodynamics is best preserved in stratigraphy constructed by systems with low water to sediment flux ratios.},

	abstract = {The dynamics between sediment erosion and accumulation at an alluvial basin margin affected by changes in the surface hydrology are explored using scaled analogue models produced in a flume. The presented results differ from previous counterparts in that accumulation or erosion has not been forced at a spreading outlet, but occurred at a slope change produced by previously accumulated sediment. Cyclical upstream incision produced by increased stream discharge generated incised valleys, and these were subsequently filled by sediment carried by less efficient streams generated during the low discharge period. High resolution mapping using 2.5 mm contour maps allowed the study of sediment accumulation and terrain modelling. The results of three selected experiments are analysed. The only variable explored was discharge. The basin margin was simulated by a ramp inserted in a low sloping flume, consisting of two segments of different slopes selected to emulate high and low efficiency flume fans produced elsewhere. Water and fine-medium sand entered the ramp along a narrow (0.1 m) channel and flow expanded but without occupying the complete 1.2 m flume width. Flows were highly concentrated and noncohesive. Fan-like accumulation (slope: 0.11) began during low discharge ({LD}) periods at the ramp slope break, and proceeded upstream, onlapping quickly at first, but shifting to mostly progradation at the end of the period. High discharges ({HD}) usually generated two or three incised channels at the beginning of the period, but one of them prevailed and rapidly eroded parts of the {LD} fan and moved the sediment to a more distal low-sloping fan (slope: 0.045). Both {LD} and {HD} fans passed downstream into a system of small parallel channels resembling a braided alluvial plain ending in sediment lobes. The mapping of the accumulated sediment during the various periods allowed calculation of sediment budgets for the entire flume. The stratal architecture of the deposits was investigated along five parallel trenches cut after experiment termination. The regression analysis of depositional profiles at fan-like features (expanding flow) and at braided plains (parallel flow) indicated that these fan-like systems are linear and dependent on applied discharge, while the latter showed an exponential decrease of slope downstream, with a starting value set up by the fan slope. Two main types of stratigraphic units were generated, the {LDST} and {HDST} (system tracts). The {LDST} has a nonerosive base over `bedrock' and the previous {HDST}, filling proximal erosional topography and prograding as well, generating an onlap±downlap array. Its geometry is highly variable and dependent on pre-existing topography. The {HDST} base is an important erosive surface comparable to sequence boundaries. However, there are places without erosion due to a marginal position with respect to the main stream. Indeed, the results suggest that the three-dimensional variability of erosion and depositional processes might produce very different architectures along the same basin margin.},

	abstract = {Methods for estimating palaeoslope from fluvial deposits have been available for some time, but new data and improved understanding of the relevant physical processes afford the possibility of improving existing methods, and the emerging field of quantitative stratigraphy provides a new context for the results. Here we focus on deriving palaeoslope estimates for coarse-grained fluvial deposits. These estimates can be used in basin analyses to constrain the magnitude of the slope change necessary for a given deflection of palaeocurrents, to constrain temporal and spatial variation in basin subsidence rate, and to provide a surface datum for use in sediment-backstripping calculations. The algorithm we derive to estimate palaeoslope applies to rivers that self-adjust through variations in channel width to maintain a temporally and spatially averaged bed shear stress equal to some constant multiple of the critical shear stress for initial motion of bed sediment. Data from modern coarse-grained rivers with minimal bank cohesion and form resistance suggest that this boundary shear stress is equal to about 1.4 times the critical shear stress for movement of the median-sized clast of the surface layer. The key sedimentological criteria for recognition of systems appropriate for this type of analysis are: (1) field relations suggesting that channel banks formed in effectively noncohesive gravel (i.e. free of clay-size sediment and plant roots); (2) absence of significant volumes of dune-derived cross-stratification; and (3) absence of indicators of extremely rapid, flash-flood-type deposition. The basic input data for a palaeoslope calculation are spatially averaged estimates of palaeodepth and median grain size. The most important aspect of data collection is that the depth and grain-size estimates should be determined independently by random sampling over the whole outcrop. Joint analysis of data from appropriate modern rivers and of errors associated with palaeodepth and grain-size estimates indicates that in coarse-grained braided-river deposits, palaeoslope can be estimated to within a factor of 2.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Laboratory-scale experiments of erosion have demonstrated that landscapes have a natural (or intrinsic) response time to a change in precipitation rate. In the last few decades there has been growth in the development of numerical models that attempt to capture landscape evolution over long timescales. However, there is still an uncertainty regarding the validity of the basic assumptions of mass transport that are made in deriving these models. In this contribution we therefore return to a principal assumption of sediment transport within the mass balance for surface processes; we explore the sensitivity of the classic end-member landscape evolution models and the sediment fluxes they produce to a change in precipitation rates. One end-member model takes the mathematical form of a kinetic wave equation and is known as the stream power model, in which sediment is assumed to be transported immediately out of the model domain. The second end-member model is the transport model and it takes the form of a diffusion equation, assuming that the sediment flux is a function of the water flux and slope. We find that both of these end-member models have a response time that has a proportionality to the precipitation rate that follows a negative power law. However, for the stream power model the exponent on the water flux term must be less than one, and for the transport model the exponent must be greater than one, in order to match the observed concavity of natural systems. This difference in exponent means that the transport model generally responds more rapidly to an increase in precipitation rates, on the order of 10$^{\textrm{5}}$ years for post-perturbation sediment fluxes to return to within 50{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of their initial values, for theoretical landscapes with a scale of 100×100{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}km. Additionally from the same starting conditions, the amplitude of the sediment flux perturbation in the transport model is greater, with much larger sensitivity to catchment size. An important finding is that both models respond more quickly to a wetting event than a drying event, and we argue that this asymmetry in response time has significant implications for depositional stratigraphies. Finally, we evaluate the extent to which these constraints on response times and sediment fluxes from simple models help us understand the geological record of landscape response to rapid environmental changes in the past, such as the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum ({PETM}). In the Spanish Pyrenees, for instance, a relatively rapid (10 to 50{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}kyr) duration of the deposition of gravel is observed for a climatic shift that is thought to be towards increased precipitation rates. We suggest that the rapid response observed is more easily explained through a diffusive transport model because (1) the model has a faster response time, which is consistent with the documented stratigraphic data, (2) there is a high-amplitude spike in sediment flux, and (3) the assumption of instantaneous transport is difficult to justify for the transport of large grain sizes as an alluvial bedload. Consequently, while these end-member models do not reproduce all the complexity of processes seen in real landscapes, we argue that variations in long-term erosional dynamics within source catchments can fundamentally control when, how, and where sedimentary archives can record past environmental change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we examine the sediments, flora, and fauna from an expanded section at Mattawoman Creek-Billingsley Road ({MCBR}) in Maryland and explore the impact of warming at a nearshore shallow marine (30–100 m water depth) site in the Salisbury Embayment. Observations indicate that at the onset of the {PETM}, the site abruptly shifted from an open marine to prodelta setting with increased terrestrial and fresh water input. Changes in microfossil biota suggest stratification of the water column and low-oxygen bottom water conditions in the earliest Eocene. Formation of authigenic carbonate through microbial diagenesis produced an unusually large bulk carbon isotope shift, while the magnitude of the corresponding signal from benthic foraminifera is similar to that at other marine sites. This proves that the landward increase in the magnitude of the carbon isotope excursion measured in bulk sediment is not due to a near instantaneous release of 12C-enriched {CO}2. We conclude that the {MCBR} site records nearshore marine response to global climate change that can be used as an analog for modern coastal response to global warming.},

	abstract = {Abstract Tectonics and climate are the major extrinsic upstream controls on both the external and internal architectures of fluvial channels. While the role of tectonics has been well-documented, the role of climate has received less attention. Because both tectonics and climate can produce similar stratigraphic architectures the ability to recognize and differentiate these has major ramifications for the interpretation of fluvial stratigraphy. The Pennsylvanian to Permian succession of the Maritimes Basin complex on Cape Breton Island is ca 5 km thick, and is composed of predominantly non-marine strata deposited within a series of depocentres characterized by different subsidence regimes. Basins in the west are transtensional depocentres characterized by episodic fault movement. In contrast, basins in the east were formed during prolonged periods of passive thermal subsidence. The stratigraphy is composed of four second order sequences (A to D), each 5 to 10 m.y. in duration. These sequences are composed of amalgamated fluvial channel deposits that fine upwards into extensive mud-dominated floodplain deposits with isolated fluvial channel bodies. A spectrum of fluvial styles is recorded within the study area including perennial, perennial/intermittent and ephemeral. Four stratigraphic intervals (E1 to E4) are recognized in which the deposits of strongly seasonal perennial/intermittent fluvial deposits are predominant. These intervals, 2 to 6 m.y. in duration, are correlated across the study area between basins with differing tectonic regimes and do not correlate with a particular position in second order sequences. This suggests that climate exerted the dominant influence on the formation of these intervals and can be differentiated from tectonic imprints. While the tectonic regime of a particular basin exerted a fundamental control on the external architecture, a coherent record of climate change is recognized in the internal architecture of fluvial units. This study demonstrates that tectonic and climatic controls can be recognized and differentiated in vertical successions by evaluating changes in fluvial architecture.

We used field measurements and historical analysis of air photos and topographic maps to identify geomorphic trends of the lower White River, Arkansas, {USA}, in the 70years following base-level lowering at its confluence with the Mississippi River and concurrent with flood control by dams. Incision was identified below a knickpoint area upstream of St. Charles, {AR}, and increases over the lowermost {\textasciitilde}90km of the study site to {\textasciitilde}2m near the confluence with the Mississippi River. Mean bankfull width increased by 30m (21\%) from 1930 to 2010. Bank widening appears to be the result of flow regulation above the incision knickpoint and concomitant with incision below the knickpoint. Hydraulic modeling indicated that geomorphic adjustments likely reduced flooding by 58\% during frequent floods in the incised, lowermost floodplain affected by backwater flooding from the Mississippi River and by 22\% above the knickpoint area. Dominance of backwater flooding in the incised reach indicates that incision is more important than flood control on the lower White River in altering flooding and also suggests that the Mississippi River may be the dominant control in shaping the lower floodplain. Overall, results highlight the complex geomorphic adjustment in large river-floodplain systems in response to anthropogenic modifications and their implications, including reduced river-floodplain connectivity.},

On long timescales, channels migrate via avulsion, the process of channel bed deposition and abandonment that often results in catastrophic flooding and loss of life on densely populated fans. We present results of an experimental fan that creates realistic channel patterns by avulsion. The avulsion cycle occurs with a period that is predictable from conservation of mass. Selection of a new flow path is inherently stochastic; however, once a network of 4–5 channels is established, flow oscillates among these channels indefinitely. We demonstrate that a directed random walk model with memory quantitatively reproduces these dynamics and limiting behavior, and is consistent with natural fans.},

	abstract = {Channel migration is a major determinant of vegetation patterns in the tower bottomlands of the southeastern-coastal plain of the United States. Lateral channel movement creates new surfaces by point-bar deposition and the filling in of abandoned channels. The new surfaces are rapidly colonized by flood-tolerant, opportunistic species. Sediment deposited during subsequent years’ flooding raises young surfaces, making them less susceptible to inundation and more suitable for the establishment of less flood-tolerant species that eventually replace the early arrivals. The continued presence of the young forest communities depends primarily on the formation of new surfaces by channel migration and the development of shallow swamps. Shallow swamps are formed when channel obstructions force water into the adjacent bottomlands, destroying forest stands and allowing the establishment of early successional species. Many of the streams in the southeastern coastal plain have been channelized. Stabilized channels limit the development of shallow swamps and preclude the formation of point bars and oxbow lakes. Therefore, the largest-scale natural disturbance mechanism and the most important factor controlling spatial heterogeneity in the lower bottomland sites has been eliminated. Channelization will likely result in a shift towards a homogeneous floodplain forest composed of later successional mesic species that occupied the outer floodplain before channelization.},

	abstract = {This paper describes and interprets the floodplain stratigraphy of two low-energy rivers in the East Midlands, U.K. and goes on to present an appropriate model of floodplain evolution that may be applicable to other lowland rivers in temperate mid-latitudes. Work has been undertaken at the reach level to try and characterize the entire system. In general only laterally extensive exposures have been used, and detailed stratigraphic and microstratigraphic recording has been used to facilitate process interpretations. All the sites have been radiocarbon dated. The dataset consists of three sites in the Soar valley and five sites in the larger Nene valley. The most common sedimentary architecture is a basal gravel with occasional shallow channels, covered by a mixed loam (sand-silt-clay) of variable thickness with landsurfaces and evidence of bioturbation. This loam is frequently interrupted by palaeochannels, and finally all these sediments are buried by a massive silt-clay unit. Most of the palaeochannels were abandoned in the early Flandrian, or between ca. 3500 years {BP} and 2000 years {BP}. The superficial silty clay is diachronous largely because of the irregular topography of the floodplain onto which it was deposited; dates from non-palaeochannel sections range from ca. 3500 {BP} to ca. 2100 years {BP}. The floodplain stratigraphy has been profoundly influenced by soil development and sub-aerial processes, especially tree-throw, which has produced distinctive sedimentary structures. The loam unit is interpreted as a soil which developed inbetween both silting palaeochannels and active channels. The landsurfaces are both earlier and contemporaneous with the later phase of channel abandonment. There is some evidence, ca. 5000-4000 {BP}, of a rise in floodplain watertables. An evolutionary model is proposed which can account for the stratigraphic evidence reported here. It is based upon the development of an anastomosing (stable multiple-channel) system from an initial braided-river topography and its eventual conversion to a predominantly single-channel system due to floodplain and channel siltation. The reduction of channels is compensated for by a change in channel types and capacities while the floodplain aggrades; this is the stable-bed aggrading-banks ({SBAB}) model, which necessitates no changes in discharges. It is suggested that the sub-meandering or straight to sinuous nature of many lowland U.K. channels may be due to their evolution from an anastomosing pattern where the least meandering channels survived typically with a box-S shape planform and at the edges of the floodplain. The sites also show that the Lateglacial fluvial history of the two catchments seems to have been very different, with incision and subsequent aggradation occurring during the Younger Dryas in the Nene but not in the Soar. Given the proximity and similarity of the two catchments this suggests that relatively minor local factors may have been able to push some catchments across fluvial thresholds. In contrast the Flandrian history of the two rivers has been broadly similar, although there is evidence of greater lateral instability and floodplain reworking in the Soar which may be due to hydrogeological factors or a different landuse history. This work strongly suggests that new process-based interpretations of floodplain stratigraphy, and new models of floodplain evolution may be required before alluvial history can be easily related to the changing Lateglacial and Flandrian climate of lowland U.K.},

This conflict can be avoided through long-term planning efforts which use process-based geomorphic simulation modeling to forecast potential long-term ({\textgreater}50 years) landscape-level effects of water management decisions on river meander migration. We describe two management conflicts from the Sacramento River, California, {USA}, and analyze alternative management scenarios using results from a meander migration and cutoff simulation model. The first example shows that the existing rock revetment upstream from Woodson Bridge State Recreation Area alters the river meandering and causes erosion problems. Removing the revetment would relocate the channel and create a natural meander-neck chute cutoff, reducing erosion at the park while providing ecosystem benefits. The second example suggests that although a bank revetment is needed to prevent the river from moving away from a major water pump, removing an upstream bank revetment would provide habitat benefits without causing pump facility problems. These examples demonstrate the benefits of taking a long-term, landscape-level view when implementing infrastructure projects in dynamic landscapes.},

Over this period fluvial activity has been characterized by alternating phases of river-bed incision and stability coinciding with non-random, decadal-scale fluctuations in flood frequency and hydroclimate that appear to be linked to changes in large-scale upper atmospheric circulation patterns. Episodes of widespread channel bed incision (1760–1799, 1875–1894, 1955–1969) result from a higher frequency of large floods ({\textgreater} 20 year return period) and cool, wet climate under meridional circulation regimes. Phases of more moderate floods (5–20 year return period), corresponding to zonal circulation types (1820–1874, 1920–1954), are characterized by enhanced lateral reworking and sediment transfer in upper reaches of the catchment, and channel narrowing and infilling downstream. Rates of fluvial activity are reduced in intermediate periods (1800–1819, 1895–1919) with no dominant circulation regime associated with lower flood frequency and magnitude. The results of this study provide a valuable guide for forecasting probable drainage basin and channel response to future climate change.},

	abstract = {Floodplain deposits are recognized as potentially large sinks for fluvial sediments, yet spatial and temporal patterns of accumulation are not known for many river systems. In the tectonically active Bengal Basin, the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers coalesce and have formed a large floodplain/delta complex, where widespread overbank flooding may deposit a significant portion of the river's estimated sediment discharge. To investigate the magnitude and distribution of this process, accumulation rates were determined by 137Cs and 210Pb radioisotope geochronology at 60 sites located in three regions of the Bengal Basin differing in age, physiography, and river influence. These geochronological methods have been applied to floodplain environments in only a few recent studies, and the present research offers a revised approach for heterogeneous systems. Patterns of sediment deposition in the Bengal Basin reveal three dominant controls on floodplain accretion: channel processes, overbank flooding, and surface runoff. Accretion is most rapid in the river braidbelt and adjacent floodplain, decreasing rapidly with distance from the main channel. Accumulation rates increase again in low-lying distal basins, where several meters of annual precipitation and associated runoff rework surrounding floodplain surfaces and transport remobilized sediments to local catchments. The extent and magnitude of this process indicate its comparable importance with overbank deposition for floodplain accumulation. A sediment budget for the study area reveals that at least 15\% of the estimated 1 billion tonnes of fluvial sediment discharge is stored annually and not reaching the oceans as previously assumed. Extrapolated to the remaining ∼60,000 km2 of floodplain not covered in this project, the sequestered load could rise to {\textgreater}30\% of annual sediment discharge.},

	abstract = {Floodplains along the braided gravel-bed Waimakariri River are discontinuous although generally extensive landforms composed predominantly of gravel bars capped with vertically accreted fines. In order of importance, three mechanisms lead to floodplain formation. River bed abandonment by lateral migration of the braid-train initiates the formation of the largest floodpiains, which usually occur downstream of tributary fans and valley bedrock spurs. In the headwater reaches, localized river bed aggradation during high magnitude events leads to floodplain formation by producing a surface resistant to erosion by lesser events due to either the coarse nature of the deposit, or by its elevation over the river bed, or both. The least important mechanism initiating floodplain development is localized river or channel incision. A six stage model is proposed for the sequential development of floodplains on the Waimakariri River from: (i) active river bed; (ii) stabilizing bar; (iii) incipient floodplain; (iv) established floodplain; (v) mature floodplain; and to (vi) terrace. Two mechanisms, lateral migration by the braid-train and reactivation of abandoned channels within floodplains, operating separately or in combination, are responsible for floodplain reworking and their relatively young age ({\textless}250 years). Clearly, braided rivers can construct substantial areas of well developed floodplain.},

	abstract = {In this study, geomorphological, sedimentological, and geochronological work was conducted on unconfined and confined reaches of three rivers in the eastern interior of South Africa in order to quantify the relative rates of floodplain reworking and alluvial preservation along river courses with variable valley confinement and lithology. Using optically stimulated luminescence ({OSL}) dating techniques, new chronologies for the Schoonspruit and Mooi River were created and the existing Klip River chronology was expanded. The results suggest that floodplains in both unconfined and confined reaches preserve complex spatial and temporal patterns of alluviation, although differences in boundary conditions lead to variation in the processes and rates of floodplain construction and reworking. On the Klip and Mooi Rivers where local base levels are stable, channels in unconfined reaches rework floodplain sediments through slow lateral migration punctuated by local erosion during avulsion events. On the Schoonspruit where base level has lowered, the channel in the unconfined reach is incised, the floodplain is abandoned, and a large gully has formed. In the confined reaches of all three rivers, the narrow floodplains are reworked by scour and fill activity and limited lateral migration. The {OSL} results suggest that unconfined reaches preserve relatively continuous alluvial records that extend into the Pleistocene, while the floodplains in the confined reaches preserve relatively discontinuous alluvial records biased toward the late Holocene. The alluvial geochronologic records in these systems preserve signals of changes in local base level controlled by variation in lithology and incision rather than climate change. By defining the processes, rates, and patterns of floodplain reworking in reaches with different degrees of valley confinement and channel incision, the findings contribute to understanding how rivers build, modify, and preserve alluvial sedimentary archives.},

The sandstone bodies, in two cases, are multi-storey, clearly demonstrating a series of vertical building episodes. The fourth sandstone body may have a ribbon or sheet geometry, and is of special interest because it demonstrates lateral building by a laterally migrating channel, as well as some vertical building.

Factors that appear to be most important in determining whether a river migrates laterally or remains stable laterally are: (1) river mean flow strength, (2) bank strength, (3) flood periodicity and duration, (4) vertical movement of the alluvial area.

	abstract = {Problems are often encountered in accurately establishing the rates of processes associated with river channel change. In this study, optical dating was used to obtain the lateral migration rate of an abandoned meander bend on the Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa. Five samples were collected by augering along a transect across an approximately 200-m-wide scroll-bar sequence on the inner meander bend, and an additional sample was collected from the channel fill of the related oxbow lake. Optically stimulated luminescence ({OSL}) ages were derived for each sample using the single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol on small aliquots of quartz. Incomplete bleaching was evident in some of the samples and thus the appropriate statistical analysis was performed using the ‘finite mixture model’ for the scroll-bar samples and the ‘minimum age model’ for the channel-fill sample. The ages calculated were in the correct chronological order for the depositional sequence, which was formed over the last ∼1000 years. The average rate of lateral migration across the scroll-bar sequence was found to be ∼0.16 m/yr but with an apparent increase in the rate occurring during the early sixteenth century. Where quartz-rich alluvium exists, the methods used in this study can potentially be applied to other river systems, enabling rates of channel change processes to be determined.},

	abstract = {Human occupation and development of alluvial river floodplains are adversely affected by river channel lateral migration, which may range as high as several hundred metres per year. Reservoirs that reduce the frequency and duration of high flows typically reduce lateral migration rates by factors of 3 to 6. The ecology of riverine corridors is dependent upon the processes of erosion and sedimentation, which lead to lateral migration. Multiple-objective use of floodplains adjacent to active rivers therefore requires tools for assessing the probability and magnitude of channel movements. Existing approaches for predicting river channel movement may be classified as empirical or mechanistic, and are inadequate for widespread application. The Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam in Montana, a major alluvial river with flow highly perturbed by regulation, was selected for case study. Maps and aerial photographs were available before and after dam construction. This imagery was analysed by digitizing channel centrelines at successive coverages under pre-dam and post-dam conditions, and mean migration rates were computed by bend and by reach. The mean rate of channel centreline migration fell from 6.6 m yr-1 to 1.8 m yr-1 after impoundment. Bend-mean channel activity rates were only weakly correlated with variables describing channel form and geometry. Results indicate that flow regulation for flood control and hydropower production typical of the study reach had profound effects on river corridor dynamism, with implications for habitat type distribution and ecosystem integrity.},

However, at the scale of one cold-warm cycle, it appears that the geomorphological effect of river activity is best expressed at times of climatic change. Such periods of pronounced fluvial action last only a short time. In more detail, the internal evolution in a drainage basin after a climatic event results in a delayed response of the morphology and sedimentation pattern. Finally, on the shortest timescale local thresholds may play a decisive role in the reactions of river systems. It is concluded that the relation between fluvial development and climate is not a simple one, but is fundamentally dependant on the timescale.},

	abstract = {Many large rivers flow through a variety of geologic materials. Within the span of several kilometres, bends may alternately flow against recently reworked sediments, older, more indurated sediments or highly resistant materials. As sediment size, cementation, and other properties strongly influence the erodibility of river banks, erosion rates and channel planform are likely to vary significantly along the length of large rivers. In order to assess the role of bank materials on bank erosion rates, we develop a method for detecting relative differences in erodibility between bank materials along large floodplains. By coupling historic patterns of channel change with a simple model of bank erodibility we are able to track relative changes in bank erodibility among time intervals and bank materials. We apply our analysis to the upper Willamette River, in northwestern Oregon for three time periods: 1850–1895, 1895–1932 and 1972–1995 and compute relative differences in bank erodibility for Holocene alluvium, partially cemented Pleistocene gravels, and revetments constructed in the 20th century. Although the Willamette is fundamentally an anastomosing river, we apply the model to single-thread portions of the channel that evolved through lateral migration. Our simple model of bank erodibility reveals that for all three-time periods, banks composed of Holocene alluvium are at least 2–5 times more erodible than banks composed of Pleistocene gravels. Revetment installed in the 20th century is highly resistant to erosion and is at least 10 times less erodible than Pleistocene gravels. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The response of fluvial systems to land use and climate change varies depending on catchment size. While forcing-response mechanisms of small catchments are reasonably well understood, the response of larger drainage basins is less clear. In particular, the impact of land use and climate change on the Rhine system is poorly understood because of the catchment size (185 000 km2) and the long history of human cultivation, which started approximately 7500 years ago. A sediment budget is calculated to specify the amount of alluvial sediment that was deposited during the Holocene and to estimate long-term soil erosion rates. The results suggest that 59±14 X 109 t of Holocene alluvial sediment is stored in the non-alpine part of the Rhine catchment (South and Central Germany, Eastern France, The Netherlands). About 50\% of Holocene alluvial sediment is deposited along the trunk valley and the delta (Upper Rhine, Lower Rhine, coastal plain), while the rest is stored along the tributary valleys. The floodplain sediment storage corresponds to a mean erosion rate of 0.55±0.16 t/ha per yr (38.5±10.7 mm/kyr) across the Rhine catchment outside the Alps. This Holocene-averaged estimate amounts for sediments that were delivered to the channel network and is at the lower limit of erosion rates from other studies of different methodology.},

The Amazon river basin hosts tributaries that are largely unaffected by engineering controls and hold a range of sediment loads, allowing us to explore the influence that sediment supply has on river evolution. Here we calculate average annual rates of meander migration within 20 reaches in the Amazon Basin from Landsat imagery spanning 1985–2013. We find that rivers with high sediment loads experience annual migration rates that are higher than those of rivers with lower sediment loads. Meander cutoff also occurs more frequently along rivers with higher sediment loads. Differences in meander migration and cutoff rates between the study reaches are not explained by differences in channel slope or river discharge. Because faster meander migration and higher cutoff rates lead to increased sediment-storage space in the resulting oxbows, we suggest that sediment supply modulates the reshaping of floodplain environments by meandering rivers. We conclude that imposed sediment loads influence planform changes in lowland rivers across the Amazon.},

Meandering channels can be classified into four types according to the influence of these cohesive deposits: (1) fixed meanders, (2) restricted meanders, (3) confined free meanders, and (4) truly free meanders. Laboratory experiments and field observations of point bars in low gradient sand-bedded meandering rivers have revealed that, unlike in gravel-bedded rivers, point bars develop in response to the pattern of flow through the bends, that is point bars in these rivers are a result rather than a cause of meandering. Point bar platforms, which are the flat tops of point bars, are gradually covered in these rivers by inner bank accretions deposited out of suspension. Therefore, bends with well developed point bar platforms lacking accretion deposits must be in a state of active channel migration and, consequently widening.},

The results show that the morphological changes of the river mouth bar have been closely associated with the largely reduced fluvial discharge and sediment load. Landform development such as bar progradation occurred in two phases, i.e. before and after 1989, which correspond to faster and lower bar growth rates, respectively. Fast riverbed aggradation in the mouth channel was strongly related to river mouth bar progradation. During 1976–1996, about 2.8\% of the total sediment loads were deposited in the river channel on the upper to middle delta. Therefore, the river water level rose by a few meters from 1984 to 1996. The frequent distributary channel migration, which switched the radial channel pattern into the {SE}-directed pattern in the mid-1980s, was linked with mouth bar formation. Marine conditions also constrain seaward bar progradation. Furthermore, the history of river mouth bar formation reflects human impacts, such as dredging and dyking in order to stabilize the coastal area.},

	abstract = {Piggyback basins developed at the mountain fronts of collisional orogens can act as important, and transient, sediment stores along major river systems. It is not clear, however, how the storage and release of sediment in piggyback basins affects the sediment flux and evolution of downstream river reaches. Here, we investigate the timing and volumes of sediment storage and release in the Dehra Dun, a piggyback basin developed along the Himalayan mountain front in northwestern India. Based on {OSL} dating, we show evidence for three major phases of aggradation in the dun, bracketed at ca. 41–33 ka, 34–21 ka and 23–10 ka, each accompanied by progradation of sediment fans into the dun. Each of these phases was followed by backfilling and (apparently) rapid fan-head incision, leading to abandonment of the depositional unit and a basinward shift of the active depocentre. Excavation of dun sediment after the second and third phases of aggradation produced time-averaged sediment discharges that were ca. 1–2\% of the modern suspended-sediment discharges of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers that traverse the margins of the dun; this sediment was derived from catchment areas that together comprise 1.5\% of the drainage area of these rivers. Comparison of the timing of dun storage and release with upstream and downstream records of incision and aggradation in the Ganga show that sediment storage in the dun generally coincides with periods of widespread hinterland aggradation but that late stages of dun aggradation, and especially times of dun sediment excavation, coincide with major periods of sediment export to the Ganga Basin. The dun thus acts to amplify temporal variations in hinterland sediment supply or transport capacity. This conceptual model appears to explain morphological features of other major river systems along the Himalayan front, including the Gandak and Kosi Rivers, and may be important for understanding sediment flux variations in other collisional mountain belts.},

We analyzed a suite of sediment transport and geomorphic data to determine the cumulative influence of different flood types on changing channel form. In this study, physically based analyses suggest that channel change in the Rio Grande is controlled by both changes in flow strength and sediment supply over different spatial and temporal scales. Channel narrowing is primarily caused by substantial deposition of sediment supplied to the Rio Grande during tributary-sourced flash floods. Tributary floods have large suspended-sediment concentrations, occur for short durations, and attenuate rapidly downstream in the Rio Grande, depositing much of their sediment in downstream reaches. Long-duration floods on the mainstem have the capacity to enlarge the Rio Grande, and these floods, released from upstream dams, can either erode or deposit sediment in the Rio Grande depending upon the antecedent in-channel sediment supply and the magnitude and duration of the flood. Geomorphic and sediment transport analyses show that the locations and rates of sand erosion and deposition during long-duration floods are most strongly controlled by spatial changes in flow strength, largely through changes in channel slope. However, spatial differences in the in-channel sediment supply regulate sediment evacuation or accumulation over time in long reaches (greater than a kilometer).},

	abstract = {Wetlands are well known to act as sinks for sediment and chemicals in the landscape. Within the Mkuze River floodplain in northern {KwaZulu}-Natal, South Africa, deposition of clastic sediment occurs predominantly in close proximity to the river channel, resulting in the formation of levees. Over time, this leads to channel avulsion, a process that may be accelerated by the activities of hippopotami whose trails create hydraulically favourable pathways. Sedimentation rates, determined using the isotopes 210Pb and 137Cs, indicate that the Mkuze River floodplain is a relatively rapidly aggrading system that should experience frequent avulsion, with average short-term rates in the order of 0.25 to 0.50cm/y. Sediments on the floodplain are also an important sink for solutes, which concentrate in the groundwater and precipitate out because of evapotranspiration. Over long timescales, chemical sedimentation affects the landscape by influencing salinity, vegetation distribution, hydrological flows, and local topography. The Mkuze River floodplain is an actively evolving system, which continues to aggrade as a result of the combination of clastic and chemical sedimentation. In a region characterised by a strong annual water deficit, temporal patterns of clastic and chemical sedimentation are likely to exert influence on the long-term development of wetland systems elsewhere in southern Africa. This study, the first on sediment accretion rates using 210Pb and 137Cs dating for a southern African wetland, demonstrates that radioisotopic methods are an important tool that can be applied toward fully understanding wetland formation, evolution, and functioning in the region.},

	abstract = {The use of sequence stratigraphic principles as a correlation tool within fluvial depositional systems has been a topic of debate for a long time. Changes in facies stacking patterns caused by allocyclic events are often masked or completely overprinted by autocyclic events and therefore the recognition of correlative time-significant markers can be difficult. These problems are more difficult to solve when trying to apply sequence stratigraphic principles to subsurface well datasets. A method is presented here based on the concepts of accommodation versus sediment supply interactions (A/S) and their variations at a hierarchy of temporal scales. These changes lead to the development of a pattern of overall increasing or decreasing A/S values reflected in the sedimentary record. The key addition to existing ideas about continental fluvial sequence stratigraphy is the notion that the rate of fluvial aggradation through time, as controlled by the accommodation versus sediment supply rate, is dynamic and not static. The use of the concepts of A/S interactions allows for the fluvial stratigraphic system to be analysed not only (or solely) in terms of regional to local base level changes that affect accommodation but as an integrated parameter with regional to local sediment supply changes. A practical definition of base level (or stratigraphic reference level) in fluvial systems is outlined and formulated as the lower boundary of real-time accommodation or upper boundary of net accommodation (lower limit to erosion). In areas not directly affected by laterally migrating fluvial channels or channel belts, the upper boundary of net accommodation at a specific time scale can in some cases be genetically coupled to the most mature palaeosols. In other cases, the upper boundary of net accommodation may be picked at a laterally extensive caliche layer formed at a depth relatively unaffected by short-term erosion and deposition. The method presented here is not meant as a substitute for previous stratigraphic methods or models for fluvial systems but as an alternative to be used as seen appropriate given the type and amount of data available. The application and limitations of this method are highlighted in a case study from the Statfjord Group, Statfjord Field, in the Norwegian North Sea.},

	abstract = {Studies in stratigraphy are often driven by the predicted climate change and possible gains for the oil and gas industry. Because, at present predictions of the development of future deltaic architecture are insufficient. This thesis addresses the problem of qualitative and quantitative understanding of sedimentary systems in two stages. In the first stage the stratigraphy of Holocene delta deposits of the Kura and Mahakam deltas (respectively in Azerbaijan en Indonesia) are studied. Results from these studies provide insights as an analogue to ancient systems and serve as an example for expected future conditions. The results form the Kura delta show a prominent role for the rapid sea-level change of the Caspian Sea, while the results of Mahakam delta suggest an important role for the eustatic Holocene sea-level curve and the absence of floods of the Mahakam River. Information obtained from studies in a similar context have the potential to reduce uncertainties and increase confidence in models. The second stage of this thesis covers the development of a process-response simulation model to assess the impact of changes in sediment supply and sea-level on fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy. Anticipating on the dominant role of sediment supply on fluvial dominated deltas, a choice is made for a detailed investigation in how to incorporate good estimates of sediment supply in the numerical model, that enable to explore the possibilities of using a probabilistic approach instead of a deterministic output or geostatistical analysis.},

	abstract = {Distinctive overbank sediments deposited since European settlement on the floodplain of the Brandywine Creek, Pennsylvania, are used to calibrate and test a diffusion model of overbank deposition. The predictions of the model can be calibrated to reproduce the topography of the post-settlement lithosome with an average error of 7\%. The model also correctly predicts the decrease in mean grain size away from the channel. The model greatly underestimates the ability of floodwaters to transport sand away from the channel. Apparently, sand is transported across the floodplain by bedload transport and by advective suspended sediment transport as well as by diffusion. If flow duration data for 1912–1981 and the present rating curve for the Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, are assumed to apply throughout the post-settlement period, the model may be used to estimate palaeohydraulic characteristics of post-settlement floods. Calculations indicate that 212 post-settlement floods covered the floodplain to an average depth of 1.6 m, transported an average excess suspended sediment concentration of 6200 ppm, and deposited an average thickness of 1.4 cm of sediment on levees next to the channel.},

	abstract = {Understanding how environmental forcings (e.g., tectonics, climate) are transformed by erosional landscapes into sedimentary signals is a critical component of inverting the stratigraphic record. Previous research has largely focused on sediment supply (Qs) and grain size as the de facto sedimentary signals of changing forcing mechanisms. We use a numerical model to consider the paired response of sediment provenance (Pv), expressed as fractional sediment load, and Qs to demonstrate that the same change in environmental forcing may have a different expression in the sedimentary record. While Qs reflects integrated denudation across an erosional catchment, Pv is controlled by spatially variable erosion that occurs in transient landscapes. Pv from proximal sediment sources increases during upstream knickpoint migration, whereas Pv from distal sediment sources increases when bedrock channels incise to produce lower gradient profiles. Differences between the Qs and Pv signals relate to distinct geomorphic processes that operate on different time scales and allow for a refined differentiation of the timing and mechanism of forcings than possible via analysis of either signal alone. Future efforts to integrate multiple sedimentary signals may thus yield a richer picture of underlying forcing mechanisms, facilitating efforts to invert the stratigraphic record.},

	abstract = {Extant, planform-based facies models for alluvial deposits are not fully fit for purpose, because they over-emphasise plan form whereas there is little in the alluvial rock record that is distinctive of any particular planform, and because the planform of individual rivers vary in both time and space. Accordingly, existing facies models have limited predictive capability. In this paper, we explore the role of inter-annual peak discharge variability as a possible control on the character of the preserved alluvial record. Data from a suite of modern rivers, for which long-term gauging records are available, and for which there are published descriptions of subsurface sedimentary architecture, are analysed. The selected rivers are categorized according to their variance in peak discharge or the coefficient of variation ({CVQp}=standard deviation of the annual peak flood discharge over the mean annual peak flood discharge). This parameter ranges over the rivers studied between 0.18 and 1.22, allowing classification of rivers as having very low ({\textless}0.20), low (0.20–0.40), moderate (0.40–0.60), high (0.60–0.90), or very high ({\textgreater}0.90) annual peak discharge variance. Deposits of rivers with very low and low peak discharge variability are dominated by cross-bedding on various scales and preserve macroform bedding structure, allowing the interpretation of bar construction processes. Rivers with moderate values preserve mostly cross-bedding, but records of macroform processes are in places muted and considerably modified by reworking. Rivers with high and very high values of annual peak discharge variability show a wide range of bedding structures commonly including critical and supercritical flow structures, abundant in situ trees and transported large, woody debris, and their deposits contain pedogenically modified mud partings and generally lack macroform structure. Such a facies assemblage is distinctively different from the conventional fluvial style recorded in published facies models but is widely developed both in modern and ancient alluvial deposits. This high-peak-variance style is also distinctive of rivers that are undergoing contraction in discharge over time because of the gradual annexation of the channel belt by the establishment of woody vegetation. We propose that discharge variability, both inter-annual peak variation and “flashiness” may be a more reliable basis for classifying the alluvial rock record than planform, and we provide some examples of three classes of alluvial sediment bodies (representing low, intermediate, and high/very high discharge variability) from the rock record that illustrate this point.},

	abstract = {Oxygen isotopic analyses of pelagic Foraminifera from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific deep-sea cores indicate that the temperature of superficial waters in the equatorial Atlantic and Caribbean underwent periodic oscillations during the Pleistocene with an amplitude of about 6° C. The temperature record of the Pacific cores was much affected by local oceanographic conditions. Seven complete temperature cycles are shown by a Caribbean core. By extrapolating rates of sedimentation based on radiocarbon data, an age of about 280,000 years is obtained for the earliest temperature minimum. Correlation with continental events suggests that the earliest temperature minimum corresponds to the first major glaciation. The chronology of Pacific cores proposed by Arrhenius (1952) must be modified if correspondence with the chronology of Atlantic and Caribbean cores is desired. In one Pacific core which extends to the Pliocene, the 610-cm. level below top is believed to represent the Plio-Pleistocene boundary. About fifteen complete temperature cycles occur above this level, and the length of Pleistocene time is estimated at about 600,000 years. The so-called pre-Günzian stages appear to span a time interval about as long as the Giinz and post-Giinzian stages. A glacial lowering of sea-level of about 100 m. is indicated. Closely spaced samples from short pilot cores furnish a detailed temperature record for postglacial times. A continuous temperature increase from about 16,500 to about 6,000 years ago is indicated, followed by a small temperature decrease. The temperature maximum at about 6,000 years ago is correlated with the "Climatic Optimum." Isotopic analyses of calcareous benthonic Foraminifera show that the temperature of bottom water in the equatorial Pacific during glacial ages was similar to the present, but in the eastern equatorial Atlantic it was about 2.1° C. lower. This difference resulted from the large amount of marine ice present in the North Atlantic. Interglacial bottom temperature in the equatorial Pacific was not more than about 0.8° C. higher than glacial temperatures; interglacial data for the equatorial Atlantic are inconclusive with respect to temperature but indicate an influx of ice meltwater along the bottom larger than at present. Correspondence in time between temperature variations in the low latitudes, as shown by the cores, and glacial events in the high northern latitudes indicates close correspondence between glacial or interglacial phases and wet or dry phases, respectively. Good correlation exists between times of temperature minima as indicated by extrapolated rates of sedimentation and times of insolation minima in high northern latitudes. Control of world climate during the Pleistocene by insolation in the high northern latitudes is indicated. A retardation of about 5,000 years occurred between temperature and insolation cycles. Complete revision of current correlations between the insolation curve and continental events is necessary. The glacial epoch and its ages may be explained by a theory combining topographical and insolation effects. Conditions may be suitable for the beginning of a new ice age in about 10,000 years.},

Data is far less available when addressing the sensitivity of common geomorphological metrics, such as channel steepness, to climatic boundary conditions. We test the relationship between channel steepness and precipitation rate by measuring a large number of channels in different mountainous areas. These regions exhibit a tenfold variation in precipitation rate between them ({\textasciitilde}100–1000mmy−1) but have similar uplift rates, allowing the tectonic variable to be controlled. By accounting for the orographic coupling of rainfall with uplifted topography, we find that channel steepness is significantly suppressed by higher precipitation rates in a measurable way that conforms to simple stream power erosion laws and empirical constraints on their parameters. We demonstrate this using modern and estimated glacial precipitation rates; and climate emerges as an important, quantifiable control on channel geometry. These findings help to explain why highly variable measurements of channel steepness are reported from different locations and provide important empirical constraints on how climate shapes tectonically active landscapes.},

Globally, soil erosion is accelerating (e.g., deforestation, some agriculture practices), while at the same time sediment flux to the coastal zone is globally decelerating (e.g., water diversion schemes, dams). Reduced loads delivered to the coastal zone result in an accelerated coastal erosion and a decrease in habitat. The reduction of the seasonal flood waves also means that sediment is dispersed over smaller areas of the continental margin. One of the great challenges facing hydrologists, with regard to our understanding of anthropogenic versus climate-change impacts on the hydrological cycle, is the quality and duration coverage of hydrological data, particularly on pristine rivers. For many rivers, the length of hydrological coverage is measured in years rather than decades, with no rivers with reliable observations across centuries. In other words, if a river's discharge is monitored during periods where the impacts of humans or nature produce a long-term trend, then the return-interval concept for floods and droughts, for instance, becomes meaningless. In addition, river systems are conditioned by events that are largely prehistorical. Forensic studies of paleoriver systems provide us with some ability to assess and discern the impacts of humans versus climate.},

	abstract = {Kaolinite usually is present in relatively small amounts in most upper Paleocene and lower Eocene neritic deposits of the northern {US} Atlantic Coastal Plain. However, there is a short period (less than 200,000k.y.) in the latest Paleocene (upper part of calcareous nannoplankton Zone {NP} 9) when kaolinite-dominated clay mineral suites replaced the usual illite/smectite-dominated suites. During this time of global biotic and lithologic changes, kaolinite increased from less than 5\% of the clay mineral suite to peak proportions of 50–60\% of the suite and then returned to less than 5\% in uppermost Paleocene/lowermost Eocene strata. This kaolinite pulse is present at numerous localities from southern Virginia to New Jersey. These sites represent both inner and middle neritic depositional environments and reflect input from several river drainage systems. Thus, it is inferred that kaolinite-rich source areas were widespread in the northeastern {US} during the latest Paleocene. Erosion of these source areas contributed the kaolinite that was transported and widely dispersed into shelf environments of the Salisbury embayment. The kaolinite increase, which occurred during a time of relatively high sea level, probably is the result of intensified weathering due to increased temperature and precipitation. The southern extent of the kaolinite pulse is uncertain in that uppermost Paleocene beds have not been identified in the southern Atlantic Coastal Plain. The late Paleocene kaolinite pulse that consists of an increase to peak kaolinite levels followed by a decrease can be used for detailed correlation between more upbasin and more downbasin sections in the Salisbury embayment. Correlations show that more upbasin Paleocene/Eocene boundary sections are erosionally truncated. They have varying portions of the kaolinite increase and, if present at all, discontinuous portions of the subsequent kaolinite decrease. As these truncated sections are disconformably overlain by lower Eocene strata, rapid erosional removal of large parts of the most kaolinite-rich P/E boundary clay deposits occurred by early Eocene time. Erosion of the kaolinite-rich P/E boundary beds was enhanced during times of sea-level fall when kaolinite-rich sediments were redeposited to produce kaolinite spikes in basal beds of lower and middle Eocene sequences that have little or no kaolinite elsewhere in the sequence. In contrast, more downbasin sites document only the upper, decreasing part of the kaolinite pulse. The absence of strata documenting the earlier kaolinite increase is attributed to slow sedimentation (condensed interval) as a result of a significant sea level rise that ponded most sediments in shallower waters, combined with the probable subsequent erosional removal of these thin downbasin deposits by oceanic currents.},

Sedimentology 36, 1–23] of the modern Saskatchewan River system (Cumberland Marshes, central Canada), and serve to characterize avulsion depositional sequences in the ancient Willwood and Fort Union Formations (Paleogene, Bighorn Basin, {NW} Wyoming, {USA}). We recognize, however, that the model is not universally applicable to avulsion-dominated successions, specifically systems which lack defining “heterolithic avulsion deposits”, set forth by Kraus and Wells [Kraus, M.J., Wells, T.M., 1999.

Based on observations (using measured sections, outcrop photo-panels, and aerial photographs) in the Willwood Formation (Eocene, Wyoming) and Ferris Formation (Cretaceous/Paleogene, Wyoming), we present two end-member categories of avulsion stratigraphy in ancient deposits; stratigraphically abrupt, when a main paleochannel is stratigraphically juxtaposed directly atop floodplain/overbank deposits, and stratigraphically transitional, where crevasse splays and other non-floodplain/-overbank deposits stratigraphically precede a main paleochannel. This characterization provides a broader, more inclusive way to recognize and describe avulsion stratigraphy in ancient deposits and may be an important factor to consider when modeling connectivity in fluvial reservoirs. Furthermore, our observations show that one type of avulsion channel stratigraphy may prevail over another within an ancient basin, suggesting that system-wide factors such as splay-proneness or avulsion style (i.e. aggradational, incisional, etc.; [Slingerland, R., Smith, N.D., 2004. River avulsions and their deposits. Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences 32, 257–285]) may be primary controls on the type of avulsion stratigraphy deposited and preserved in ancient basin-fills.},

	abstract = {Detailed investigations of high latitude sequences recently collected by the Ocean Drilling Program ({ODP}) indicate that periods of rapid climate change often culminated in brief transient climates, with more extreme conditions than subsequent long term climates. Two examples of such events have been identified in the Paleogene; the first in latest Paleocene time in the middle of a warming trend that began several million years earlier: the second in earliest Oligocene time near the end of a Middle Eocene to Late Oligocene global cooling trend. Superimposed on the earlier event was a sudden and extreme warming of both high latitude sea surface and deep ocean waters. Imbedded in the latter transition was an abrupt decline in high latitude temperatures and the brief appearance of a full size continental ice-sheet on Antarctica. In both cases the climate extremes were not stable, lasting for less than a few hundred thousand years, indicating a temporary or transient climate state. Geochemical and sedimentological evidence suggest that both Paleogene climate events were accompanied by reorganizations in ocean circulation, and major perturbations in marine productivity and the global carbon cycle. The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum was marked by reduced oceanic turnover and decreases in global  and in marine productivity, while the Early Oligocene glacial maximum was accompanied by intensification of deep ocean circulation and elevated  and productivity. It has been suggested that sudden changes in climate and/or ocean circulation might occur as a result of gradual forcing as certain physical thresholds are exceeded. We investigate the possibility that sudden reorganizations in ocean and/or atmosphere circulation during these abrupt transitions generated short-term positive feedbacks that briefly sustained these transient climatic states.},

The carbon isotope compositions of marine carbonate sediments from the late Palaeocene vary considerably, exhibiting a sudden decrease close to the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary which coincides with deep-sea benthic extinctions1 and with changes in ocean circulation. Here we report that these fluctuations in the marine carbon isotope record are closely tracked by the terrestrial records provided by palaeosol carbonates and mammalian tooth enamel. In using palaeosol carbonates to reconstruct the {CO}2 content of the ancient atmosphere2, isotope shifts of this sort will have to be taken into account. The sharp decrease in 13C/12C ratios in the late Palaeocene provides a datum for precise correlation of marine and continental records, and suggests that abrupt climate warming at this time may have played an important role in the evolution of land mammals.},

A triangular diagram is used to define eight rock types (orthoquartzite, arkose, graywacke, and five transitional types) based on the mineralogy of the silt-sand-gravel fraction and ignoring clay content. The writer contends that the current practice of calling all clayey sandstones "graywackes" is not valid, inasmuch as it represents a confusion of texture with composition.

	abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum ({PETM}) is one of the best known examples of a transient climate perturbation, associated with a brief, but intense, interval of global warming and a massive perturbation of the global carbon cycle from injection of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system. One key to quantifying the mass of carbon released, identifying the source(s), and understanding the ultimate fate of this carbon is to develop high-resolution age models. Two independent strategies have been employed, cycle stratigraphy and analysis of extraterrestrial helium ({HeET}), both of which were first tested on Ocean Drilling Program ({ODP}) Site 690. These two methods are in agreement for the onset of the {PETM} and initial recovery, or the clay layer (“main body”), but seem to differ in the final recovery phase of the event above the clay layer, where the carbonate contents rise and carbon isotope values return toward background values. Here we present a state-of-the-art age model for the {PETM} derived from a new orbital chronology developed with cycle stratigraphic records from sites drilled during {ODP} Leg 208 (Walvis Ridge, Southeastern Atlantic) integrated with published records from Site 690 (Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean, {ODP} Leg 113). During Leg 208, five Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary sections (Sites 1262 to 1267) were recovered in multiple holes over a depth transect of more than 2200 m at the Walvis Ridge, yielding the first stratigraphically complete P-E deep-sea sequence with moderate to relatively high sedimentation rates (1 to 3 cm/ka, where “a” is years). A detailed chronology was developed with nondestructive X-ray fluorescence ({XRF}) core scanning records on the scale of precession cycles, with a total duration of the {PETM} now estimated to be ∼170 ka. The revised cycle stratigraphic record confirms original estimates for the duration of the onset and initial recovery but suggests a new duration for the final recovery that is intermediate to the previous estimates by cycle stratigraphy and {HeET}.},

Here, I review constraints on the onset duration of the carbon isotope excursion ({CIE}) that is characteristic of the event with a focus on carbon cycle model-based attempts that forgo the need for a traditional sedimentary age model. I also review and compare existing {PETM} carbon input scenarios employing the Earth system model {cGENIE} and suggest another possibility—that abrupt input of an isotopically depleted carbon source combined with elevated volcanic outgassing over a longer interval can together account for key features of the {PETM} {CIE}.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Hyperthermals: rapid and extreme global warming in our geological past’.},

This work assesses the implications of climate change for future flood hazard in Europe. Regional climate simulations from the {HIRHAM} model with 12-km horizontal resolution were used to drive the hydrological model {LISFLOOD}, and extreme value techniques were applied to the results to estimate the probability of extreme discharges. It was found that by the end of this century under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios ({SRES}) A2 emissions scenario in many European rivers extreme discharge levels may increase in magnitude and frequency. In several rivers, most notably in the west and parts of eastern Europe, the return period of what is currently a 100-year flood may in the future decrease to 50 years or less. A considerable decrease in flood hazard was found in the northeast, where warmer winters and a shorter snow season reduce the magnitude of the spring snowmelt peak. Also in other rivers in central and southern Europe a decrease in extreme river flows was simulated. The results were compared with those obtained with two {HIRHAM} experiments at 50-km resolution for the {SRES} A2 and B2 scenarios. Disagreements between the various model experiments indicate that the effect of the horizontal resolution of the regional climate model is comparable in magnitude to the greenhouse gas scenario. Also, the choice of extreme value distribution to estimate discharge extremes influences the results, especially for events with higher return periods.},

Repeated transect measurements of braided channels, formed at several different combinations of slope and discharge, show that, despite large temporal and spatial fluctuations, mean active channel width and depth show an orderly relationship equivalent to the classical downstream hydraulic geometry. Similarly, for a given particle-size distribution, braiding intensity increases with increasing discharge and total stream power, as predicted from theory. Temporal fluctuations in channel form parameters correlate with periodic pulses in bed load over a time scale of hours in the models (probably equivalent to days or weeks in prototype streams). The pulses are generated internally by local degradation and aggradation. Increasing bed-load input to a stream reach causes local aggradation, increased braiding intensity and an increase in the number of migrating, avalanche-face, unit bars. These groups of migrating bars are the primary means of downstream transfer of bed-load pulses. Transfer tends to occur as a downstream progression from one aggradational area (complex bar) to another, through an intervening confluence zone.

The bypass fraction is found by calculating a characteristic excursion length for every grain size making up a particular train of dunes. All particles with excursion lengths greater than the downstream span of the lee face of the average dune are assumed not to contribute to dune propagation. Bypass fractions based on distributions of excursion lengths account for the discrepancies between total sediment discharge and dune migration rate measured by Stein [1965] and Guy et al.

Calculations and these data agree over sediment-transporting conditions associated with the entire stability field for dunes composed of medium sand. The two laboratory studies show that commonly 30-60\% of all sand moving over fully developed dunes is not deposited on slip faces. Measurements from the North Loup River reveal that of all sediment moving over the dune crests there, roughly 45\% is not being captured on lee faces even though 99\% of sediment is transported within 2 cm of the bed. The method developed herein successfully estimates measured values for the bypass fraction from 0 to 80\%. Our analysis indicates that the division between grains that are deposited versus those that are bypassing falls within the range of sand sizes making up the suspended load at dune crests.},

	abstract = {While boundary and forcing conditions influence the average location of a shoreline in deltaic systems, internal morphodynamics can drive high-magnitude deviations from the long-term trend. Here we explore the role of sediment cohesion on these morphodynamics using physical experiments. Specifically, we explore the role of sediment cohesion on the scales of autogenic shoreline transgressions and regressions. Results indicate that sediment cohesion enhances the time and space scales associated with autogenic cycles of channel formation, elongation, and abandonment. In systems with high sediment cohesion, this cycle can drive shoreline transgressions that produce flooding surfaces in the resulting stratigraphy which could be confused with surfaces produced by increases in sea level rise or subsidence rates. Enhanced channelization resulting from sediment cohesion also increases the pumping of fine-grained sediment into the marine realm, where it can bypass the delta foreset, thus decreasing total delta sediment retention rate.},

	abstract = {Laboratory observations regarding the limit conditions for particle entrainment into suspension are presented. A high-speed video system was used to investigate conditions for the entrainment of sediment particles and glass beads lying over a smooth boundary as well as over a rough bed. The results extend experimental conditions of previous studies towards finer particle sizes. A criterion for the limit of entrainment into suspension is proposed which is a function of the ratio between the flow shear velocity and particle settling velocity. Observations indicate that particles totally immersed within the viscous sublayer can be entrained into suspension by the flow, which contradicts the conclusions of previous researchers. A theoretical analysis of the entrainment process within the viscous sublayer, based on force–balance considerations, is used to show that this phenomenon is related to turbulent flow events of high instantaneous values of the Reynolds stress, in agreement with previous observations. In the case of experiments with a rough bed, a hiding effect was observed, which tends to preclude the entrainment of particles finer than the roughness elements. This implies that, as the ratio between particle and roughness element sizes becomes smaller, progressively higher bed shear stresses are required to entrain particles into suspension. On the other hand, an overexposure effect was also observed, which indicates that a particle moving on a smooth bed is more prone to be entrained than the same particle moving on a bed formed by identical particles.},

	abstract = {The low temporal completeness of fluvial strata could indicate that recorded events represent unusual and extreme conditions. However, field observations suggest that preserved strata predominantly record relatively common transport conditions—a paradox termed the strange ordinariness of fluvial strata. We theorize that the self-organization of fluvial systems into a morphodynamic hierarchy that spans bed to basin scales facilitates the preservation of ordinary events in fluvial strata. Using a new probabilistic model and existing field and experimental data sets across these scales, we show that fluvial morphodynamic hierarchy enhances the stratigraphic preservation of medial topography—ordinary events. We show that lower-order landforms have a higher likelihood of complete preservation when the kinematic rates of evolution of successive levels in the morphodynamic hierarchy are comparable. We highlight how relative changes in kinematic rates of evolution of successive levels in the morphodynamic hierarchy can manifest as major shifts in stratigraphic architecture through Earth history.},
