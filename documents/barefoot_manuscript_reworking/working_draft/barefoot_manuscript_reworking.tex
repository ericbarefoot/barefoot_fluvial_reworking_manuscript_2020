\section{Introduction}

\pnote[so, so many papers open with "The PETM is the most..." so would prefer to start with a more relevant statement about surface processes controlling stratigraphic architecture of alluvial deposits.]

The Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is the most severe climate perturbation known in the Cenozoic Era.
The PETM is associated with altered hydrological cycling and precipitation extremes driven by rapid warming and accumulation of atmospheric carbon.
As such, it serves as the best-known, and best-studied past analogue for contemporary anthropogenic climate warming.
By studying paleo-environmental change during the PETM, we can better understand the mechanisms by which landscapes respond to rapid climate warming.
Insights derived from the paleoenvironmental record of the PETM can be leveraged to guide and improve climate models and long-term hazard forecasts.

The stratigraphic record of the PETM generally indicates that altered hydrological cycling and temperature patterns impacted landscapes and sedimentary systems.
Associated most often with a distinct, abrupt shift in sedimentary facies, the PETM has been identified to coincide with lithostratigraphic contacts globally.
For example, the PETM is connected to increased terrestrial fine-grained flux to marginal marine environments \cnote[miller], coarsening and braiding of fluvial environments \cnote[pujalte], and \pnote[something else..?? or just add BZF to last one.]

Overall, these globally-distributed observations suggest that terrestrial sediment transport systems responded to accommodate altered hydrological cycling, but mechanisms invoked for this response are ambiguous or inconclusive.
Generally, previous studies suggest that increased discharge \cnote[recent Nature Reports], transient increases in sediment flux \cnote[who was I thinking of?], or fluvial steepening \cnote[bzf 2014] are responsible for changes in fluvial style and sediment transport.
However, it has not been demonstrated that changes in total water and sediment flux are necessary conditions for sedimentological changes in fluvial systems during the PETM.

Previous work has generally relied on observations of sedimentary structures that correlate with channel and floodplain geometries, i.e. channel depths, channel widths, bedload grain size, and reach-averaged slope.
Testing hypotheses of fluvial paleohydraulics with geometry-based methods is complicated by uncertainty inherent in the inversion relationships, as well as unknown variance fluvial geometries in the floodplain \pnote[this is vague, so just clarify later that you mean that we don't really know how variable channel depth is across a floodplain in the modern.].
Furthermore, geometric models for paleohydraulics require extrapolation to infer the dynamics of the fluvial system, introducing additional error and uncertainty.
However, recent work has highlighted new methods to directly estimate relative rates of channel processes, or derive a proxy for relative rates of channel kinematics.
When combined with geometric observations, indicators of fluvial paleokinematics may help to capture both the total scale of the system and its behavior as the system evolved through PETM time.

% new tack: previous studies generally use geometry-based paleohydraulic methods or qualitative methods, but these do not tell the whole story, and are typically just partial proxies for fluvial dynamics.
% recent work has highlighted new ways to estimate some aspects of fluvial kinematics, which, when combined with geometric models for paleohydraulics, offers new insight to constrain the fluvial response problem.
% In this study, we combine indicators of geometric and kinematic shifts in the fluvial system in the Piceance Basin as a result of climatic forcing during the PETM.
% Accordingly, it is often difficult in stratigraphic studies to tell the difference between signal and noise.

% it is not well understood whether increased fluxes of sediment are required to enrich the floodplain in sand.
% Rather, channel mobility alone could be the culprit.

Therefore, we return to the Piceance Creek Basin, a field site previously studied as a case study of fluvial response to altered hydrological cycling during the PETM.
Studies of the Piceance Basin to date \pnote[is it just BZF?] have remained equivocal as to the precise mechanisms generating fluvial response at the PETM boundary.
In particular, it is not clear whether fluvial systems experienced net increases in sediment and water flux during the PETM.
Increased fluxes and floodplain diffusivity implies (increasing/decreasing) river gradients and more active channel kinematics, which should be expected to be preserved in the stratigraphic record.
Nonetheless, these predictions have not been tested with paleohydraulic techniques developed in recent years since the initial studies on the Piceance Basin.

In particular, the \cnote[BZF] model predicts that higher sediment and water fluxes generated deeper, coarser channels, and higher floodplain diffusivity with a lower gradient.
As a result, river channel geometries would be expected to grow, and estimates of slope are expected to decrease, while kinematics, or reworking, is expected to increase with a transient increase in sediment flux.
We also consider an alternative case, where mean sediment flux and water discharge is constant, but intra-annual variability in the flow conditions changes during the PETM.

Here, we deploy recently developed paleohydraulic techniques to evaluate hypothesized changes in fluvial geometries and kinematics and develop a new model for fluvial response to climatic perturbation.

\section{Study Site and Methods}

% Brief summary of Piceance Basin stratigraphy

To study the impacts of PETM-modulated changes in hydrological cycling, we turn to the Piceance Creek Basin, an intermontane Laramide depocenter active throughout the Paleogene and Eocene \cnote.
Sedimentary fill of the Piceance Creek Basin is conformable across the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and records climate conditions integrated over approximately \pnote[this much area] km$^2$ of drainage area during the PETM \cnote.
In the Piceance Creek Basin, \del{13}{C}{org} records of the PETM interval correlates with a distinctive sand-rich unit known as the Molina Member of the Wasatch Formation \cnote[bzf].

Juxtaposed between mud-rich units, the Molina Member exhibits starkly different sedimentological characteristics as opposed to the underlying Atwell Gulch Member and the overlying Shire member of the Wasatch Formation.
While the Atwell Gulch and Shire members are composed largely of isolated channel sand bodies confined within a matrix of fine-grained overbank deposits, the Molina member comprises interconnected, sheetlike amalgamated sand bodies with relatively thin intervening layers of floodplain fines.
The distinctive sand enrichment in the Molina member has been attributed to a fluvial response to climate-induced changes to hydrological cycling during the PETM.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the interpreted fluvial response remain unclear.
The current accepted model invokes a transient increase in water and sediment flux to generate the selective deposition of coarse channel facies in the Molina member \cnote[bzf].
It is difficult to distinguish between this scenario and alternative depositional histories though, because the equivalent signal could feasibly be generated through increased channel dynamics, independent of the net increase in sediment or water supply \pnote[this is kind of the crucial piece. STOP BURYING THE LEAD].
More detailed and precise paleohydraulic methods may shed light on the relative importance of sediment supply and channel dynamics in the Piceance Basin, as these different sources of sedimentological change are predicted to alter the geometrical and kinematic properties of fluvial channels in dinstinctive ways.

The Piceance Creek is a uniquely suited locale for testing hypothesized landscape responses to climate perturbation using fluvial paleohydraulics.
While climate is expected to influence basin dynamics significantly, other key allogenic forcing parameters such as tectonic uplift/subsidence and base level fluctuations have been previously shown to be either negligible or invariant through the PETM interval.
Detrital zircon analysis and formation geometries argue against a sediment supply increase due to tectonic uplift or unroofing of sand-rich units in the hinterland.
Additionally, the great distance of the paleo-shoreline ($>1000$km) and a lack of evidence for temporally-variable subsidence indicate that neither of these allogenic mechanisms are likely to have influenced sedimentary stacking in the Piceance Creek Basin.

% It’s a good site for our study because it experienced:
%
%   No documented changes in subsidence history during this interval
%
%   No changes in sediment provenance
%
%   No evidence for tectonically-driven increases in sediment flux
%
%   Paleoshoreline at a great distance (1000s of kilometers)

A climate-induced change in hydrological cycling, therefore, is the most parsimonious explanation for observed facies changes and enrichment of sand in the Molina member.
However, to better understand how the mechanisms by which fluvial systems responded to altered hydrological cycling, it is necessary to distinguish between a scenario involving increased sediment and water flux and a scenario where average sediment supply and discharge were constant, but channel dynamics were different.
We will distinguish between these scenarios by employing detailed paleohydraulic reconstructions of Molina fluvial systems as contrasted with Atwell Gulch and Shire alluvial systems.
The main geometric attribute that is hypothesized to distinguish between these two scenarios are the size of channel deposits (particularly depth) and the reach-averaged slope of channels.

Our paleohydraulic toolkit for this study includes two methods to reconstruct bankfull channel depths, one method to reconstruct paleoslope, and a new technique for estimating reworking by avulsions and lateral migration.
The main considerations for choosing paleohydraulic inversion techniques included a robust accounting of uncertainty in the model framework, and simple application to ancient deposits.
3D models of outcrops were derived from drone imagery and used to map bar clinoform structures, channel-fill structures, and bedding surfaces.
We estimate paleo-flow depths primarily by measuring the total relief of fully preserved bar clinoforms \cnote[what is the old citation on this?].
When outcrops lacked fully preserved bar strata, we estimate flow depth by measuring the distribution of cross-stratification thicknesses, and using empirical relations to convert dune cross-stratification to flow depth, with associated uncertainty.
Flow depth estimates, and grain size information for interpreted bedload deposits are combined in an empirical relation from \cnote[trampush] to derive an estimate of paleoslope.
Finally, the relative proportions of fully-preserved, partially preserved, and truncated bar strata were estimated to derive an index of fluvial reworking.

We connect our estimates of paleohydraulic parameters to a simple box-model approach to determine how sand enrichment in the floodplain should vary as a function of channel dynamics versus sediment supply.
This model takes as parameters fluvial sediment flux, grain size distribution (sand v mud), basin geometries, and subsidence rate.
Floodplain sediment composition is determined in this model by the relative proportion of channel deposits vs overbank sediments, each of which have a predetermined sand concentration, where channels have a higher enrichment in sand.
Channel sand-bodies rework overbank sediments, replacing them with channel deposits.
By varying channel geometries and kinematic rates relative to subsidence rates, channel deposits occupy more or less of the morphodynamic reworking zone.
In this way, based on observations of the total enrichment in sand, the abundance of channel deposits, and the frequency of cross-cutting relationships, inferences are made of channel geometries and kinematic rates as a function of floodplain parameters.

\section{Results and Interpretations}

% No change in paleogeometries
%   Partially a function of poor resolution
%   Indicate that channel geometries likely did not change by more than a factor of 10
%   This implies that rivers did not necessarily carry a higher discharge or sediment flux

Paleohydraulic estimates from the Piceance Creek indicate that measured channel geometries were invariant across the PETM boundary.
Our estimates of paleoflow depth and paleoslope show no differences between the Molina Member and the bounding Atwell Gulch and Shire members \pnote[insert a p value here].
Despite clear differences in sedimentology between the three members, these results suggest that within the resolution of our current methods, rivers during the PETM were no steeper or deeper than before or after the climate perturbation.
This implies that rivers in the Piceance Basin did not necessarily carry an increased sediment flux or higher discharge as a result of changes to regional climate and hydrological cycling.

Paleohydraulic estimates are, however, difficult to estimate in outcrop with certainty. Estimates of river geometries rely on empirical relations developed from modern systems.
Statistical inference for paleoslope, for example, is limited in resolution to a factor of 10 \cnote.
It is therefore feasible that paleoslope in the Piceance Creek Basin could have changed by less than a factor of ten, and the current state of the art methods would not be able to detect the change.
The poor resolution of techniques based on channel geometries alone limits inference in the ancient record, and prompts the refinement of existing paleohydraulic models and the development of new ones.

% More floodplain reworking during PETM interval
%   Shown through increased cross-cutting of bar deposits
%   Also through changes in avulsion style (hope to add this if we bring in Liz)
%   Probably due to flashier hydrograph
%   Implies faster lateral migration rates and avulsion rates.
%   This process could explain coarsening of deposits without invoking higher fluxes.

With no strong evidence for increased total fluxes of water or sediment in channel geometries, we turn to the complimentary question of interpreting channel paleokinematics.
We employ a newly developed technique that quantifies the interrelationship and reworking of fluvial structures, thereby \mnote[attacking]{better word} the kinematics of fluvial channels during the PETM in the Piceance Basin.
Drone imagery was collected from \pnote[how many?] outcrops throughout the Shire, Molina, and Atwell Gulch members of the Wasatch Formation and was processed using photogrammetry to generate 3D models of outcrops.
This drone imagery was interpreted using \pnote[may use the software.] and barform structures identified and mapped. geometric information was collected for all barforms, as well as their interrelationships and degree of preservation.

Barforms in the Molina member intersect each other more often, crosscut each other more frequently, and are less well preserved than in either the Shire or Atwell Gulch members.
The overall geometries of fully-preserved barforms indicates that channels were not substantially deeper, or that channel threads were substantially wider, but rather that channel forms revisited locations frequently, cross-cutting previously deposited structures and reworking the floodplain surface.
These data imply that while channel morphology and geometries were very similar before, during, and after the PETM, channels were more laterally mobile or avulsed more frequently, causing increased reworking of the floodplain surface.

Additionally, we mapped channel-belt boundaries and classified channel-forms by their avulsion style, data for which indicate that there were more \pnote[progradational/incisional] avulsions in the PETM interval.
These results too suggest more rapid channel kinematics, which 

Increased sand fraction of fluvial deposits during PETM
  Related to avulsion and lateral migration “combing” or “distilling” of the floodplain, excavating fine material, re-exposing it transport, and distributing sand parcels across the floodplain.
  An individual parcel of floodplain material therefore had a higher likelihood of being reworked, which likely increased the exposure frequency of floodplain organic matter to oxidation

*this prob belongs in the next section.
  The converse of this assertion is sand is preferentially bypassed during Atwell and Shire time, likely due to stable channels that act as conduits for coarse sediment.

\section{Conclusions and Implications}


Higher paleodischarges and sediment fluxes have been invoked to explain sedimentological differences in the Piceance and other basin, but we do not find this to be supported by paleohydraulics.

Instead, the same effect can be achieved by varying only the lateral migration rate of the channel, and partitioning more channel sediment to deposits.

Before the PETM, the initial hydrological regime favored meandering channels that seldom avulsed and laterally migrated through bar accretion.

As a result of the PETM, an altered hydrograph increased channel activity, driving more channel sediment to be deposited in floodplains. This could be because of:
    Destabilized banks (less vegetation)
    Increased frequency of avulsion triggers

Therefore, the sedimentological signature of the PETM can be generated with a simple increase in channel mobility.
