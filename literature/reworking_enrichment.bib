	abstract = {Various, but related, models have been proposed to explain the architectural arrangement of channel stacking patterns in avulsion-dominated alluvial sequences. The early models published by Leeder, Allen, and Bridge ({LAB}) addressed the role of changes in sedimentation rate (a proxy for subsidence rate) as a control on stacking patterns. The models decouple avulsion frequency from sedimentation rates, resulting in an inverse relationship between stacking density (or interconnectedness) and sedimentation rates. A key element missing from these models is the likely dependence of avulsion frequency on local sedimentation rate within the active channel belt. We consider a simple model whereby avulsion takes place only when a minimum, critical, relief is developed between a channel bank and the adjacent flood plain. If avulsion frequency increases at rates slower than the increase in sedimentation rate, then stacking density increases with decreasing sedimentation rate, similar to that predicted by the {LAB} models. However, if avulsion frequency increases linearly with sedimentation rate, then there is no change in stacking pattern with changes in sedimentation rate. If avulsion frequency increases faster than sedimentation rates, as seen in some data sets, then stacking patterns become more dense with increasing sedimentation rates, a result that is the exact opposite of that predicted by the {LAB} models. Therefore sensitive dependence on the relationship between avulsion frequency and sedimentation rate calls into question the veracity of some previous interpretations of relative subsidence made in alluvial architecture studies. We provide an alternative, simple geometric model that links changes in subsidence rate to downstream rate of change in stacking pattern as seen in three dimensions within sedimentary basins. Other controls that are considered include: the geometry of subsidence; whether avulsions take place locally along a river or regionally affect the basin; whether local sedimentation rate or flow depth controls the thickness of sand bodies; and the exact relationship between avulsion frequency and sedimentation rate. The primary result of the model is that subsidence strongly influences the rate at which alluvial architecture changes in the downstream direction, but other controls dictate whether the stacking pattern becomes more dense or less dense downstream. Hence, we suggest that subsidence exerts an influence on stacking patterns not necessarily evident in individual vertical sections, but may be recorded in three dimensions as downstream changes in alluvial architecture. Unfortunately any model of alluvial architecture in avulsion-dominated sequences is limited by our lack of understanding of the processes controlling avulsion. As a result any model of alluvial stacking patterns is at best a working hypothesis that should not be taken as proof of changes in tectonic subsidence rates or sea-level changes.},

	abstract = {The quantitative model presented simulates the development of a two-dimensional alluvial sedimentary succession beneath a floodplain traversed by a single major river. Several inter-related effects which influence the distribution of channel-belt sand and gravel bodies within overbank fines are accounted for. These are (a) laterally variable aggradation, (b) compaction of fine sediment, (c) tectonic movement at floodplain margins, and (d) channel avulsion. Selected experiments with the model show how the interconnectedness and areal density of channel-belt deposits decrease with increasing floodplain width/channel-belt size, mean avulsion period, and channel-belt aggradation rate. Separation of stream patterns based on interconnectedness and channel deposit density is difficult. Tectonic movements do not have a significant influence upon the successions unless a preferred direction of tilting is maintained (half-graben). Then channel-belt deposits showing offlap tendencies tend to cluster adjacent to the active floodplain margin, leaving dominantly fine-grained alluvium to accumulate on the inactive side. Individual channel-belt deposits thicken during aggradation, although a self-regulating limit to such thickening is likely to operate. ‘Multistorey’features resulting from aggradation may be difficult to tell apart from those arising through superposition of distinct channel-belt deposits of avulsive origin.},

The physical characteristics of the sediment record are controlled by three main factors: the sediment supply from the eroding source region, the grain size distribution of that sediment supply, and the area available for sediment accumulation in the downstream regions3,4. The interplay of these factors can make the interpretation of a climatic or tectonic signal complex, particularly as these processes are nonlinear. Here we assess the evolution of a tectonically active landscape undergoing erosional and depositional processes, using a numerical model that incorporates variations in grain size and the volumetric sediment budget. Our simulations indicate that changes in precipitation and tectonic uplift both generate characteristic patterns of grain size and stratigraphic geometry. An increase in catchment precipitation results in the deposition of a laterally extensive sheet of coarse gravel. The responses to a changing tectonic regime are more diverse: a large increase in uplift rate results first in the deposition of sediments of larger grain size at proximal sites, followed by a reduction in grain size at distal locations. We conclude that the stratigraphic record is strongly controlled by the grain size of sediments released from catchments undergoing tectonic or climatic change.},

	abstract = {{AbstractStratigraphy} contains the most complete record of information necessary to quantitatively reconstruct paleolandscape dynamics, but this record contains significant gaps over a range of time and space scales. These gaps result from stasis on geomorphic surfaces and erosional events that remove previously deposited sediment. Building on earlier statistical studies, we examine stratigraphic completeness in three laboratory experiments where the topography of aggrading deltas was monitored at high temporal and spatial scales. The three experiments cover unique combinations in the absolute magnitudes of sediment and water discharge in addition to generation of accommodation space through base-level rise. This analysis centers on three time scales: (1) the time at which a record is discretized (t), (2) the time necessary to build a deposit with mean thickness equivalent to the maximum roughness on a surface (Tc), and (3) the time necessary for channelized flow to migrate over all locations in a basin (Tch). These time scales incorporate information pertaining to the time-variant topography of actively changing surfaces, kinematics by which the surfaces are changing, and net deposition rate. We find that stratigraphic completeness increases as a function of t/Tc but decreases as a function of Tc/Tch over the parameter space covered in the experiments. Our results suggest that environmental signals disconnected from a sediment routing system are best preserved in systems with low Tc values. Nondimensionalizing t by Tc, however, shows that preservation of information characterizing system morphodynamics is best preserved in stratigraphy constructed by systems with low water to sediment flux ratios.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Laboratory-scale experiments of erosion have demonstrated that landscapes have a natural (or intrinsic) response time to a change in precipitation rate. In the last few decades there has been growth in the development of numerical models that attempt to capture landscape evolution over long timescales. However, there is still an uncertainty regarding the validity of the basic assumptions of mass transport that are made in deriving these models. In this contribution we therefore return to a principal assumption of sediment transport within the mass balance for surface processes; we explore the sensitivity of the classic end-member landscape evolution models and the sediment fluxes they produce to a change in precipitation rates. One end-member model takes the mathematical form of a kinetic wave equation and is known as the stream power model, in which sediment is assumed to be transported immediately out of the model domain. The second end-member model is the transport model and it takes the form of a diffusion equation, assuming that the sediment flux is a function of the water flux and slope. We find that both of these end-member models have a response time that has a proportionality to the precipitation rate that follows a negative power law. However, for the stream power model the exponent on the water flux term must be less than one, and for the transport model the exponent must be greater than one, in order to match the observed concavity of natural systems. This difference in exponent means that the transport model generally responds more rapidly to an increase in precipitation rates, on the order of 10$^{\textrm{5}}$ years for post-perturbation sediment fluxes to return to within 50{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of their initial values, for theoretical landscapes with a scale of 100×100{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}km. Additionally from the same starting conditions, the amplitude of the sediment flux perturbation in the transport model is greater, with much larger sensitivity to catchment size. An important finding is that both models respond more quickly to a wetting event than a drying event, and we argue that this asymmetry in response time has significant implications for depositional stratigraphies. Finally, we evaluate the extent to which these constraints on response times and sediment fluxes from simple models help us understand the geological record of landscape response to rapid environmental changes in the past, such as the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum ({PETM}). In the Spanish Pyrenees, for instance, a relatively rapid (10 to 50{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}kyr) duration of the deposition of gravel is observed for a climatic shift that is thought to be towards increased precipitation rates. We suggest that the rapid response observed is more easily explained through a diffusive transport model because (1) the model has a faster response time, which is consistent with the documented stratigraphic data, (2) there is a high-amplitude spike in sediment flux, and (3) the assumption of instantaneous transport is difficult to justify for the transport of large grain sizes as an alluvial bedload. Consequently, while these end-member models do not reproduce all the complexity of processes seen in real landscapes, we argue that variations in long-term erosional dynamics within source catchments can fundamentally control when, how, and where sedimentary archives can record past environmental change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The response of fluvial systems to land use and climate change varies depending on catchment size. While forcing-response mechanisms of small catchments are reasonably well understood, the response of larger drainage basins is less clear. In particular, the impact of land use and climate change on the Rhine system is poorly understood because of the catchment size (185 000 km2) and the long history of human cultivation, which started approximately 7500 years ago. A sediment budget is calculated to specify the amount of alluvial sediment that was deposited during the Holocene and to estimate long-term soil erosion rates. The results suggest that 59±14 X 109 t of Holocene alluvial sediment is stored in the non-alpine part of the Rhine catchment (South and Central Germany, Eastern France, The Netherlands). About 50\% of Holocene alluvial sediment is deposited along the trunk valley and the delta (Upper Rhine, Lower Rhine, coastal plain), while the rest is stored along the tributary valleys. The floodplain sediment storage corresponds to a mean erosion rate of 0.55±0.16 t/ha per yr (38.5±10.7 mm/kyr) across the Rhine catchment outside the Alps. This Holocene-averaged estimate amounts for sediments that were delivered to the channel network and is at the lower limit of erosion rates from other studies of different methodology.},

	abstract = {Many large rivers flow through a variety of geologic materials. Within the span of several kilometres, bends may alternately flow against recently reworked sediments, older, more indurated sediments or highly resistant materials. As sediment size, cementation, and other properties strongly influence the erodibility of river banks, erosion rates and channel planform are likely to vary significantly along the length of large rivers. In order to assess the role of bank materials on bank erosion rates, we develop a method for detecting relative differences in erodibility between bank materials along large floodplains. By coupling historic patterns of channel change with a simple model of bank erodibility we are able to track relative changes in bank erodibility among time intervals and bank materials. We apply our analysis to the upper Willamette River, in northwestern Oregon for three time periods: 1850–1895, 1895–1932 and 1972–1995 and compute relative differences in bank erodibility for Holocene alluvium, partially cemented Pleistocene gravels, and revetments constructed in the 20th century. Although the Willamette is fundamentally an anastomosing river, we apply the model to single-thread portions of the channel that evolved through lateral migration. Our simple model of bank erodibility reveals that for all three-time periods, banks composed of Holocene alluvium are at least 2–5 times more erodible than banks composed of Pleistocene gravels. Revetment installed in the 20th century is highly resistant to erosion and is at least 10 times less erodible than Pleistocene gravels. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, at the scale of one cold-warm cycle, it appears that the geomorphological effect of river activity is best expressed at times of climatic change. Such periods of pronounced fluvial action last only a short time. In more detail, the internal evolution in a drainage basin after a climatic event results in a delayed response of the morphology and sedimentation pattern. Finally, on the shortest timescale local thresholds may play a decisive role in the reactions of river systems. It is concluded that the relation between fluvial development and climate is not a simple one, but is fundamentally dependant on the timescale.},

	abstract = {Human occupation and development of alluvial river floodplains are adversely affected by river channel lateral migration, which may range as high as several hundred metres per year. Reservoirs that reduce the frequency and duration of high flows typically reduce lateral migration rates by factors of 3 to 6. The ecology of riverine corridors is dependent upon the processes of erosion and sedimentation, which lead to lateral migration. Multiple-objective use of floodplains adjacent to active rivers therefore requires tools for assessing the probability and magnitude of channel movements. Existing approaches for predicting river channel movement may be classified as empirical or mechanistic, and are inadequate for widespread application. The Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam in Montana, a major alluvial river with flow highly perturbed by regulation, was selected for case study. Maps and aerial photographs were available before and after dam construction. This imagery was analysed by digitizing channel centrelines at successive coverages under pre-dam and post-dam conditions, and mean migration rates were computed by bend and by reach. The mean rate of channel centreline migration fell from 6.6 m yr-1 to 1.8 m yr-1 after impoundment. Bend-mean channel activity rates were only weakly correlated with variables describing channel form and geometry. Results indicate that flow regulation for flood control and hydropower production typical of the study reach had profound effects on river corridor dynamism, with implications for habitat type distribution and ecosystem integrity.},

	abstract = {Problems are often encountered in accurately establishing the rates of processes associated with river channel change. In this study, optical dating was used to obtain the lateral migration rate of an abandoned meander bend on the Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa. Five samples were collected by augering along a transect across an approximately 200-m-wide scroll-bar sequence on the inner meander bend, and an additional sample was collected from the channel fill of the related oxbow lake. Optically stimulated luminescence ({OSL}) ages were derived for each sample using the single-aliquot regenerative-dose protocol on small aliquots of quartz. Incomplete bleaching was evident in some of the samples and thus the appropriate statistical analysis was performed using the ‘finite mixture model’ for the scroll-bar samples and the ‘minimum age model’ for the channel-fill sample. The ages calculated were in the correct chronological order for the depositional sequence, which was formed over the last ∼1000 years. The average rate of lateral migration across the scroll-bar sequence was found to be ∼0.16 m/yr but with an apparent increase in the rate occurring during the early sixteenth century. Where quartz-rich alluvium exists, the methods used in this study can potentially be applied to other river systems, enabling rates of channel change processes to be determined.},

Using optically stimulated luminescence ({OSL}) dating techniques, new chronologies for the Schoonspruit and Mooi River were created and the existing Klip River chronology was expanded. The results suggest that floodplains in both unconfined and confined reaches preserve complex spatial and temporal patterns of alluviation, although differences in boundary conditions lead to variation in the processes and rates of floodplain construction and reworking. On the Klip and Mooi Rivers where local base levels are stable, channels in unconfined reaches rework floodplain sediments through slow lateral migration punctuated by local erosion during avulsion events. On the Schoonspruit where base level has lowered, the channel in the unconfined reach is incised, the floodplain is abandoned, and a large gully has formed. In the confined reaches of all three rivers, the narrow floodplains are reworked by scour and fill activity and limited lateral migration. The {OSL} results suggest that unconfined reaches preserve relatively continuous alluvial records that extend into the Pleistocene, while the floodplains in the confined reaches preserve relatively discontinuous alluvial records biased toward the late Holocene. The alluvial geochronologic records in these systems preserve signals of changes in local base level controlled by variation in lithology and incision rather than climate change. By defining the processes, rates, and patterns of floodplain reworking in reaches with different degrees of valley confinement and channel incision, the findings contribute to understanding how rivers build, modify, and preserve alluvial sedimentary archives.},

	abstract = {Floodplains along the braided gravel-bed Waimakariri River are discontinuous although generally extensive landforms composed predominantly of gravel bars capped with vertically accreted fines. In order of importance, three mechanisms lead to floodplain formation. River bed abandonment by lateral migration of the braid-train initiates the formation of the largest floodpiains, which usually occur downstream of tributary fans and valley bedrock spurs. In the headwater reaches, localized river bed aggradation during high magnitude events leads to floodplain formation by producing a surface resistant to erosion by lesser events due to either the coarse nature of the deposit, or by its elevation over the river bed, or both. The least important mechanism initiating floodplain development is localized river or channel incision. A six stage model is proposed for the sequential development of floodplains on the Waimakariri River from: (i) active river bed; (ii) stabilizing bar; (iii) incipient floodplain; (iv) established floodplain; (v) mature floodplain; and to (vi) terrace. Two mechanisms, lateral migration by the braid-train and reactivation of abandoned channels within floodplains, operating separately or in combination, are responsible for floodplain reworking and their relatively young age ({\textless}250 years). Clearly, braided rivers can construct substantial areas of well developed floodplain.},

	abstract = {Floodplain deposits are recognized as potentially large sinks for fluvial sediments, yet spatial and temporal patterns of accumulation are not known for many river systems. In the tectonically active Bengal Basin, the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers coalesce and have formed a large floodplain/delta complex, where widespread overbank flooding may deposit a significant portion of the river's estimated sediment discharge. To investigate the magnitude and distribution of this process, accumulation rates were determined by 137Cs and 210Pb radioisotope geochronology at 60 sites located in three regions of the Bengal Basin differing in age, physiography, and river influence. These geochronological methods have been applied to floodplain environments in only a few recent studies, and the present research offers a revised approach for heterogeneous systems. Patterns of sediment deposition in the Bengal Basin reveal three dominant controls on floodplain accretion: channel processes, overbank flooding, and surface runoff. Accretion is most rapid in the river braidbelt and adjacent floodplain, decreasing rapidly with distance from the main channel. Accumulation rates increase again in low-lying distal basins, where several meters of annual precipitation and associated runoff rework surrounding floodplain surfaces and transport remobilized sediments to local catchments. The extent and magnitude of this process indicate its comparable importance with overbank deposition for floodplain accumulation. A sediment budget for the study area reveals that at least 15\% of the estimated 1 billion tonnes of fluvial sediment discharge is stored annually and not reaching the oceans as previously assumed. Extrapolated to the remaining ∼60,000 km2 of floodplain not covered in this project, the sequestered load could rise to {\textgreater}30\% of annual sediment discharge.},

Over this period fluvial activity has been characterized by alternating phases of river-bed incision and stability coinciding with non-random, decadal-scale fluctuations in flood frequency and hydroclimate that appear to be linked to changes in large-scale upper atmospheric circulation patterns. Episodes of widespread channel bed incision (1760–1799, 1875–1894, 1955–1969) result from a higher frequency of large floods ({\textgreater} 20 year return period) and cool, wet climate under meridional circulation regimes. Phases of more moderate floods (5–20 year return period), corresponding to zonal circulation types (1820–1874, 1920–1954), are characterized by enhanced lateral reworking and sediment transfer in upper reaches of the catchment, and channel narrowing and infilling downstream. Rates of fluvial activity are reduced in intermediate periods (1800–1819, 1895–1919) with no dominant circulation regime associated with lower flood frequency and magnitude. The results of this study provide a valuable guide for forecasting probable drainage basin and channel response to future climate change.},

This conflict can be avoided through long-term planning efforts which use process-based geomorphic simulation modeling to forecast potential long-term ({\textgreater}50 years) landscape-level effects of water management decisions on river meander migration. We describe two management conflicts from the Sacramento River, California, {USA}, and analyze alternative management scenarios using results from a meander migration and cutoff simulation model. The first example shows that the existing rock revetment upstream from Woodson Bridge State Recreation Area alters the river meandering and causes erosion problems. Removing the revetment would relocate the channel and create a natural meander-neck chute cutoff, reducing erosion at the park while providing ecosystem benefits. The second example suggests that although a bank revetment is needed to prevent the river from moving away from a major water pump, removing an upstream bank revetment would provide habitat benefits without causing pump facility problems. These examples demonstrate the benefits of taking a long-term, landscape-level view when implementing infrastructure projects in dynamic landscapes.},

	abstract = {This paper describes and interprets the floodplain stratigraphy of two low-energy rivers in the East Midlands, U.K. and goes on to present an appropriate model of floodplain evolution that may be applicable to other lowland rivers in temperate mid-latitudes. Work has been undertaken at the reach level to try and characterize the entire system. In general only laterally extensive exposures have been used, and detailed stratigraphic and microstratigraphic recording has been used to facilitate process interpretations. All the sites have been radiocarbon dated. The dataset consists of three sites in the Soar valley and five sites in the larger Nene valley. The most common sedimentary architecture is a basal gravel with occasional shallow channels, covered by a mixed loam (sand-silt-clay) of variable thickness with landsurfaces and evidence of bioturbation. This loam is frequently interrupted by palaeochannels, and finally all these sediments are buried by a massive silt-clay unit. Most of the palaeochannels were abandoned in the early Flandrian, or between ca. 3500 years {BP} and 2000 years {BP}. The superficial silty clay is diachronous largely because of the irregular topography of the floodplain onto which it was deposited; dates from non-palaeochannel sections range from ca. 3500 {BP} to ca. 2100 years {BP}. The floodplain stratigraphy has been profoundly influenced by soil development and sub-aerial processes, especially tree-throw, which has produced distinctive sedimentary structures. The loam unit is interpreted as a soil which developed inbetween both silting palaeochannels and active channels. The landsurfaces are both earlier and contemporaneous with the later phase of channel abandonment. There is some evidence, ca. 5000-4000 {BP}, of a rise in floodplain watertables. An evolutionary model is proposed which can account for the stratigraphic evidence reported here. It is based upon the development of an anastomosing (stable multiple-channel) system from an initial braided-river topography and its eventual conversion to a predominantly single-channel system due to floodplain and channel siltation. The reduction of channels is compensated for by a change in channel types and capacities while the floodplain aggrades; this is the stable-bed aggrading-banks ({SBAB}) model, which necessitates no changes in discharges. It is suggested that the sub-meandering or straight to sinuous nature of many lowland U.K. channels may be due to their evolution from an anastomosing pattern where the least meandering channels survived typically with a box-S shape planform and at the edges of the floodplain. The sites also show that the Lateglacial fluvial history of the two catchments seems to have been very different, with incision and subsequent aggradation occurring during the Younger Dryas in the Nene but not in the Soar. Given the proximity and similarity of the two catchments this suggests that relatively minor local factors may have been able to push some catchments across fluvial thresholds. In contrast the Flandrian history of the two rivers has been broadly similar, although there is evidence of greater lateral instability and floodplain reworking in the Soar which may be due to hydrogeological factors or a different landuse history. This work strongly suggests that new process-based interpretations of floodplain stratigraphy, and new models of floodplain evolution may be required before alluvial history can be easily related to the changing Lateglacial and Flandrian climate of lowland U.K.},

	abstract = {Channel migration is a major determinant of vegetation patterns in the tower bottomlands of the southeastern-coastal plain of the United States. Lateral channel movement creates new surfaces by point-bar deposition and the filling in of abandoned channels. The new surfaces are rapidly colonized by flood-tolerant, opportunistic species. Sediment deposited during subsequent years’ flooding raises young surfaces, making them less susceptible to inundation and more suitable for the establishment of less flood-tolerant species that eventually replace the early arrivals. The continued presence of the young forest communities depends primarily on the formation of new surfaces by channel migration and the development of shallow swamps. Shallow swamps are formed when channel obstructions force water into the adjacent bottomlands, destroying forest stands and allowing the establishment of early successional species. Many of the streams in the southeastern coastal plain have been channelized. Stabilized channels limit the development of shallow swamps and preclude the formation of point bars and oxbow lakes. Therefore, the largest-scale natural disturbance mechanism and the most important factor controlling spatial heterogeneity in the lower bottomland sites has been eliminated. Channelization will likely result in a shift towards a homogeneous floodplain forest composed of later successional mesic species that occupied the outer floodplain before channelization.},

On long timescales, channels migrate via avulsion, the process of channel bed deposition and abandonment that often results in catastrophic flooding and loss of life on densely populated fans. We present results of an experimental fan that creates realistic channel patterns by avulsion. The avulsion cycle occurs with a period that is predictable from conservation of mass. Selection of a new flow path is inherently stochastic; however, once a network of 4–5 channels is established, flow oscillates among these channels indefinitely. We demonstrate that a directed random walk model with memory quantitatively reproduces these dynamics and limiting behavior, and is consistent with natural fans.},

We used field measurements and historical analysis of air photos and topographic maps to identify geomorphic trends of the lower White River, Arkansas, {USA}, in the 70years following base-level lowering at its confluence with the Mississippi River and concurrent with flood control by dams. Incision was identified below a knickpoint area upstream of St. Charles, {AR}, and increases over the lowermost {\textasciitilde}90km of the study site to {\textasciitilde}2m near the confluence with the Mississippi River. Mean bankfull width increased by 30m (21\%) from 1930 to 2010. Bank widening appears to be the result of flow regulation above the incision knickpoint and concomitant with incision below the knickpoint. Hydraulic modeling indicated that geomorphic adjustments likely reduced flooding by 58\% during frequent floods in the incised, lowermost floodplain affected by backwater flooding from the Mississippi River and by 22\% above the knickpoint area. Dominance of backwater flooding in the incised reach indicates that incision is more important than flood control on the lower White River in altering flooding and also suggests that the Mississippi River may be the dominant control in shaping the lower floodplain. Overall, results highlight the complex geomorphic adjustment in large river-floodplain systems in response to anthropogenic modifications and their implications, including reduced river-floodplain connectivity.},
